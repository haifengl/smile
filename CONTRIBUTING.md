# How to contribute to Smile
Welcome! If you are interested in contributing to Smile, reporting issues,
or just getting in touch with the folks who work on Smile, this guide is
for you.

One of the easiest ways to contribute is to participate in discussions
and discuss issues. You can also contribute by opening an issue and
submitting a pull request with code changes.

## Open an issue
For bugs, issues, or other discussion, please log a new issue in the GitHub repo.

GitHub supports [markdown](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/),
so when filing bugs make sure you check the formatting before clicking submit.

## Other discussions
For general "how-to" and guidance questions about using Smile to build
and run applications, please use [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/smile-ai)
tagged with `smile-ai`.

## Contributing code and content
We welcome all forms of contributions from the community. Please read the
following guidelines to maximize the chances of your PR being merged.

### Communication
 - Before starting work on a feature, please open an issue on GitHub
   describing the proposed feature. We want to make sure any feature
   work goes smoothly. We're happy to work with you to determine if
   it fits the current project direction and make sure no one else
   is already working on it.

 - For any work related to setting up build, test, and CI for Smile
   on GitHub, or for small patches or bug fixes, please open an issue
   for tracking purposes, but we generally don't need a discussion
   prior to opening a PR.

### Development process
Please be sure to follow the usual process for submitting PRs:

 - Fork the repo
 - Create a pull request
 - Make sure your PR title is descriptive
 - Include a link back to an open issue in the PR description

We reserve the right to close PRs that are not making progress. Closed PRs can be reopened again later and work can resume.
