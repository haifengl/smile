                   SMILE LICENSE INFORMATION

    Copyright (c) 2010-2020 Haifeng Li. All rights reserved.

  SMILE employs a dual license model designed to meet the development
  and distribution needs of both commercial distributors (such as OEMs,
  ISVs and VARs) and open source projects.


GNU Lesser General Public License Usage

  SMILE may be used under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
  License version 3 as published by the Free Software Foundation and
  appearing in the file COPYING.LESSER included in the Software.
  In order to preserve the true meaning of open development and uphold
  the spirit of free software, it is imperative that the rules and
  regulations of open source licenses required by the Free Software
  Foundation are followed. Learn more: http://www.gnu.org/licenses.

  The SMILE open source licensing is ideal for use cases such as
  Free Open Source Software ("FOSS") applications under the (L)GPL
  that want to combine and distribute those FOSS applications with
  SMILE software, student/academic purposes, hobby projects,
  internal research projects without external distribution,
  or other projects where all (L)GPL obligations can be met.



Commercial License Usage

  OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers), ISVs (Independent Software
  Vendors), VARs (Value Added Resellers) and other distributors that
  combine and distribute commercially licensed software with SMILE
  must enter into a commercial license agreement with SMILE.AI, LLC.

  The commercial SMILE license gives you the full rights to create
  and distribute software on your own terms without any open source
  license obligations. With the commercial license you also have
  access to the official SMILE Support and close strategic relationship
  with SMILE.AI, LLC to make sure your development goals are met.
