/**
 * t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) is a nonlinear
 * dimensionality reduction technique that is particularly well suited
 * for embedding high-dimensional data into a space of two or three
 * dimensions, which can then be visualized in a scatter plot. Specifically,
 * it models each high-dimensional object by a two- or three-dimensional
 * point in such a way that similar objects are modeled by nearby points
 * and dissimilar objects are modeled by distant points.
 * <p>
 * The t-SNE algorithm comprises two main stages. First, t-SNE constructs
 * a probability distribution over pairs of high-dimensional objects in
 * such a way that similar objects have a high probability of being picked,
 * whilst dissimilar points have an infinitesimal probability of being picked.
 * Second, t-SNE defines a similar probability distribution over the points
 * in the low-dimensional map, and it minimizes the Kullback–Leibler
 * divergence between the two distributions with respect to the locations
 * of the points in the map. Note that whilst the original algorithm uses
 * the Euclidean distance between objects as the base of its similarity
 * metric, this should be changed as appropriate.
