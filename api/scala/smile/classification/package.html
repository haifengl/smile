          <div id="comment" class="fullcommenttop"><div class="comment cmt"><p>Classification algorithms. In machine learning and pattern recognition,
classification refers to an algorithmic procedure for assigning a given
input object into one of a given number of categories. The input
object is formally termed an instance, and the categories are termed classes.</p><p>The instance is usually described by a vector of features, which together
constitute a description of all known characteristics of the instance.
Typically, features are either categorical (also known as nominal, i.e.
consisting of one of a set of unordered items, such as a gender of &quot;male&quot;
or &quot;female&quot;, or a blood type of &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;AB&quot; or &quot;O&quot;), ordinal (consisting
of one of a set of ordered items, e.g. &quot;large&quot;, &quot;medium&quot; or &quot;small&quot;),
integer-valued (e.g. a count of the number of occurrences of a particular
word in an email) or real-valued (e.g. a measurement of blood pressure).</p><p>Classification normally refers to a supervised procedure, i.e. a procedure
that produces an inferred function to predict the output value of new
instances based on a training set of pairs consisting of an input object
and a desired output value. The inferred function is called a classifier
if the output is discrete or a regression function if the output is
continuous.</p><p>The inferred function should predict the correct output value for any valid
input object. This requires the learning algorithm to generalize from the
training data to unseen situations in a &quot;reasonable&quot; way.</p><p>A wide range of supervised learning algorithms is available, each with
its strengths and weaknesses. There is no single learning algorithm that
works best on all supervised learning problems. The most widely used
learning algorithms are AdaBoost and gradient boosting, support vector
machines, linear regression, linear discriminant analysis, logistic
regression, naive Bayes, decision trees, k-nearest neighbor algorithm,
and neural networks (multilayer perceptron).</p><p>If the feature vectors include features of many different kinds (discrete,
discrete ordered, counts, continuous values), some algorithms cannot be
easily applied. Many algorithms, including linear regression, logistic
regression, neural networks, and nearest neighbor methods, require that
the input features be numerical and scaled to similar ranges (e.g., to
the [-1,1] interval). Methods that employ a distance function, such as
nearest neighbor methods and support vector machines with Gaussian kernels,
are particularly sensitive to this. An advantage of decision trees (and
boosting algorithms based on decision trees) is that they easily handle
heterogeneous data.</p><p>If the input features contain redundant information (e.g., highly correlated
features), some learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, logistic
regression, and distance based methods) will perform poorly because of
numerical instabilities. These problems can often be solved by imposing
some form of regularization.</p><p>If each of the features makes an independent contribution to the output,
then algorithms based on linear functions (e.g., linear regression,
logistic regression, linear support vector machines, naive Bayes) generally
perform well. However, if there are complex interactions among features,
then algorithms such as nonlinear support vector machines, decision trees
and neural networks work better. Linear methods can also be applied, but
the engineer must manually specify the interactions when using them.</p><p>There are several major issues to consider in supervised learning:</p><ul><li><b>Features:</b>
The accuracy of the inferred function depends strongly on how the input
object is represented. Typically, the input object is transformed into
a feature vector, which contains a number of features that are descriptive
of the object. The number of features should not be too large, because of
the curse of dimensionality; but should contain enough information to
accurately predict the output.
There are many algorithms for feature selection that seek to identify
the relevant features and discard the irrelevant ones. More generally,
dimensionality reduction may seek to map the input data into a lower
dimensional space prior to running the supervised learning algorithm.</li><li><b>Overfitting:</b>
Overfitting occurs when a statistical model describes random error
or noise instead of the underlying relationship. Overfitting generally
occurs when a model is excessively complex, such as having too many
parameters relative to the number of observations. A model which has
been overfit will generally have poor predictive performance, as it can
exaggerate minor fluctuations in the data.
The potential for overfitting depends not only on the number of parameters
and data but also the conformability of the model structure with the data
shape, and the magnitude of model error compared to the expected level
of noise or error in the data.
In order to avoid overfitting, it is necessary to use additional techniques
(e.g. cross-validation, regularization, early stopping, pruning, Bayesian
priors on parameters or model comparison), that can indicate when further
training is not resulting in better generalization. The basis of some
techniques is either (1) to explicitly penalize overly complex models,
or (2) to test the model's ability to generalize by evaluating its
performance on a set of data not used for training, which is assumed to
approximate the typical unseen data that a model will encounter.</li><li><b>Regularization:</b>
Regularization involves introducing additional information in order
to solve an ill-posed problem or to prevent over-fitting. This information
is usually of the form of a penalty for complexity, such as restrictions
for smoothness or bounds on the vector space norm.
A theoretical justification for regularization is that it attempts to impose
Occam's razor on the solution. From a Bayesian point of view, many
regularization techniques correspond to imposing certain prior distributions
on model parameters.</li><li><b>Bias-variance tradeoff:</b>
Mean squared error (MSE) can be broken down into two components:
variance and squared bias, known as the bias-variance decomposition.
Thus in order to minimize the MSE, we need to minimize both the bias and
the variance. However, this is not trivial. Therefore, there is a tradeoff
between bias and variance.

      <p class="shortcomment cmt">AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) classifier with decision trees.</p><div class="fullcomment"><div class="comment cmt"><p>AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) classifier with decision trees. In principle,
AdaBoost is a meta-algorithm, and can be used in conjunction with many other
learning algorithms to improve their performance. In practice, AdaBoost with
decision trees is probably the most popular combination. AdaBoost is adaptive
in the sense that subsequent classifiers built are tweaked in favor of those
instances misclassified by previous classifiers. AdaBoost is sensitive to
noisy data and outliers. However in some problems it can be less susceptible
to the over-fitting problem than most learning algorithms.</p><p>AdaBoost calls a weak classifier repeatedly in a series of rounds from
total T classifiers. For each call a distribution of weights is updated
that indicates the importance of examples in the data set for the
classification. On each round, the weights of each incorrectly classified
example are increased (or alternatively, the weights of each correctly
classified example are decreased), so that the new classifier focuses more
on those examples.</p><p>The basic AdaBoost algorithm is only for binary classification problem.
For multi-class classification, a common approach is reducing the
multi-class classification problem to multiple two-class problems.
This implementation is a multi-class AdaBoost without such reductions.</p><h6>References:</h6><ul><li>Yoav Freund, Robert E. Schapire.

      <p class="shortcomment cmt">Decision tree.</p><div class="fullcomment"><div class="comment cmt"><p>Decision tree. A decision tree can be learned by
splitting the training set into subsets based on an attribute value
test. This process is repeated on each derived subset in a recursive
manner called recursive partitioning. The recursion is completed when
the subset at a node all has the same value of the target variable,
or when splitting no longer adds value to the predictions.</p><p>The algorithms that are used for constructing decision trees usually
work top-down by choosing a variable at each step that is the next best
variable to use in splitting the set of items. &quot;Best&quot; is defined by how
well the variable splits the set into homogeneous subsets that have
the same value of the target variable. Different algorithms use different
formulae for measuring &quot;best&quot;. Used by the CART algorithm, Gini impurity
is a measure of how often a randomly chosen element from the set would
be incorrectly labeled if it were randomly labeled according to the
distribution of labels in the subset. Gini impurity can be computed by
summing the probability of each item being chosen times the probability
of a mistake in categorizing that item. It reaches its minimum (zero) when
all cases in the node fall into a single target category. Information gain
is another popular measure, used by the ID3, C4.5 and C5.0 algorithms.
Information gain is based on the concept of entropy used in information
theory. For categorical variables with different number of levels, however,
information gain are biased in favor of those attributes with more levels.
Instead, one may employ the information gain ratio, which solves the drawback
of information gain.</p><p>Classification and Regression Tree techniques have a number of advantages
over many of those alternative techniques.</p><ul><li><b>Simple to understand and interpret:</b>
In most cases, the interpretation of results summarized in a tree is
very simple. This simplicity is useful not only for purposes of rapid
classification of new observations, but can also often yield a much simpler
&quot;model&quot; for explaining why observations are classified or predicted in a
particular manner.</li><li><b>Able to handle both numerical and categorical data:</b>
Other techniques are usually specialized in analyzing datasets that
have only one type of variable.</li><li><b>Nonparametric and nonlinear:</b>
The final results of using tree methods for classification or regression
can be summarized in a series of (usually few) logical if-then conditions
(tree nodes). Therefore, there is no implicit assumption that the underlying
relationships between the predictor variables and the dependent variable
are linear, follow some specific non-linear link function, or that they
are even monotonic in nature. Thus, tree methods are particularly well
suited for data mining tasks, where there is often little a priori
knowledge nor any coherent set of theories or predictions regarding which
variables are related and how. In those types of data analytics, tree
methods can often reveal simple relationships between just a few variables
that could have easily gone unnoticed using other analytic techniques.</li></ul><p>One major problem with classification and regression trees is their high
variance. Often a small change in the data can result in a very different
series of splits, making interpretation somewhat precarious. Besides,
decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that cause over-fitting.
Mechanisms such as pruning are necessary to avoid this problem.
Another limitation of trees is the lack of smoothness of the prediction
surface.</p><p>Some techniques such as bagging, boosting, and random forest use more than
one decision tree for their analysis.

distributions to be the ratio of the variance between the classes to
the variance within the classes, which is, in some sense, a measure
of the signal-to-noise ratio for the class labeling. FLD finds a linear
combination of features which maximizes the separation after the projection.
The resulting combination may be used for dimensionality reduction
before later classification.</p><p>The terms Fisher's linear discriminant and LDA are often used
interchangeably, although FLD actually describes a slightly different
discriminant, which does not make some of the assumptions of LDA such
as normally distributed classes or equal class covariances.
When the assumptions of LDA are satisfied, FLD is equivalent to LDA.</p><p>FLD is also closely related to principal component analysis (PCA), which also
looks for linear combinations of variables which best explain the data.
As a supervised method, FLD explicitly attempts to model the
difference between the classes of data. On the other hand, PCA is a
unsupervised method and does not take into account any difference in class.</p><p>One complication in applying FLD (and LDA) to real data
occurs when the number of variables/features does not exceed
the number of samples. In this case, the covariance estimates do not have
full rank, and so cannot be inverted. This is known as small sample size

pseudo-residuals. Let J be the number of its leaves. The tree partitions
the input space into J disjoint regions and predicts a constant value in
each region. The parameter J controls the maximum allowed
level of interaction between variables in the model. With J = 2 (decision
stumps), no interaction between variables is allowed. With J = 3 the model
may include effects of the interaction between up to two variables, and
so on. Hastie et al. comment that typically 4 &le; J &le; 8 work well
for boosting and results are fairly insensitive to the choice of in
this range, J = 2 is insufficient for many applications, and J &gt; 10 is
unlikely to be required.</p><p>Fitting the training set too closely can lead to degradation of the model's
generalization ability. Several so-called regularization techniques reduce
this over-fitting effect by constraining the fitting procedure.
One natural regularization parameter is the number of gradient boosting
iterations T (i.e. the number of trees in the model when the base learner
is a decision tree). Increasing T reduces the error on training set,
but setting it too high may lead to over-fitting. An optimal value of T
is often selected by monitoring prediction error on a separate validation
data set.</p><p>Another regularization approach is the shrinkage which times a parameter
&eta; (called the &quot;learning rate&quot;) to update term.
Empirically it has been found that using small learning rates (such as
&eta; &lt; 0.1) yields dramatic improvements in model's generalization ability
over gradient boosting without shrinking (&eta; = 1). However, it comes at
the price of increasing computational time both during training and
prediction: lower learning rate requires more iterations.</p><p>Soon after the introduction of gradient boosting Friedman proposed a
minor modification to the algorithm, motivated by Breiman's bagging method.
Specifically, he proposed that at each iteration of the algorithm, a base
learner should be fit on a subsample of the training set drawn at random
without replacement. Friedman observed a substantial improvement in
gradient boosting's accuracy with this modification.</p><p>Subsample size is some constant fraction f of the size of the training set.
When f = 1, the algorithm is deterministic and identical to the one
described above. Smaller values of f introduce randomness into the
algorithm and help prevent over-fitting, acting as a kind of regularization.
The algorithm also becomes faster, because regression trees have to be fit
to smaller datasets at each iteration. Typically, f is set to 0.5, meaning
that one half of the training set is used to build each base learner.</p><p>Also, like in bagging, sub-sampling allows one to define an out-of-bag
estimate of the prediction performance improvement by evaluating predictions
on those observations which were not used in the building of the next
base learner. Out-of-bag estimates help avoid the need for an independent
validation dataset, but often underestimate actual performance improvement
and the optimal number of iterations.</p><p>Gradient tree boosting implementations often also use regularization by
limiting the minimum number of observations in trees' terminal nodes.
It's used in the tree building process by ignoring any splits that lead
to nodes containing fewer than this number of training set instances.
Imposing this limit helps to reduce variance in predictions at leaves.</p><h6>References:</h6><ul><li>J. H. Friedman. Greedy Function Approximation: A Gradient Boosting Machine, 1999.</li><li>J. H. Friedman. Stochastic Gradient Boosting, 1999.

      <p class="shortcomment cmt">K-nearest neighbor classifier.</p><div class="fullcomment"><div class="comment cmt"><p>K-nearest neighbor classifier.
The k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN) is
a method for classifying objects by a majority vote of its neighbors,
with the object being assigned to the class most common amongst its k
nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small).
k-NN is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning where the
function is only approximated locally and all computation
is deferred until classification.</p><p>The best choice of k depends upon the data; generally, larger values of
k reduce the effect of noise on the classification, but make boundaries
between classes less distinct. A good k can be selected by various
heuristic techniques, e.g. cross-validation. In binary problems, it is
helpful to choose k to be an odd number as this avoids tied votes.</p><p>A drawback to the basic majority voting classification is that the classes
with the more frequent instances tend to dominate the prediction of the
new object, as they tend to come up in the k nearest neighbors when
the neighbors are computed due to their large number. One way to overcome
this problem is to weight the classification taking into account the
distance from the test point to each of its k nearest neighbors.</p><p>Often, the classification accuracy of k-NN can be improved significantly
if the distance metric is learned with specialized algorithms such as
Large Margin Nearest Neighbor or Neighborhood Components Analysis.</p><p>Nearest neighbor rules in effect compute the decision boundary in an
implicit manner. It is also possible to compute the decision boundary
itself explicitly, and to do so in an efficient manner so that the
computational complexity is a function of the boundary complexity.</p><p>The nearest neighbor algorithm has some strong consistency results. As
the amount of data approaches infinity, the algorithm is guaranteed to
yield an error rate no worse than twice the Bayes error rate (the minimum
achievable error rate given the distribution of the data). k-NN is
guaranteed to approach the Bayes error rate, for some value of k (where k
increases as a function of the number of data points).

analysis, which also attempt to express one dependent variable as a
linear combination of other features or measurements. In the other two
methods, however, the dependent variable is a numerical quantity, while
for LDA it is a categorical variable (i.e. the class label). Logistic

Logistic regression (logit model) is a generalized
linear model used for binomial regression. Logistic regression applies
maximum likelihood estimation after transforming the dependent into
a logit variable. A logit is the natural log of the odds of the dependent
equaling a certain value or not (usually 1 in binary logistic models,
the highest value in multinomial models). In this way, logistic regression
estimates the odds of a certain event (value) occurring.</p><p>Goodness-of-fit tests such as the likelihood ratio test are available
as indicators of model appropriateness, as is the Wald statistic to test
the significance of individual independent variables.</p><p>Logistic regression has many analogies to ordinary least squares (OLS)
regression. Unlike OLS regression, however, logistic regression does not
assume linearity of relationship between the raw values of the independent
variables and the dependent, does not require normally distributed variables,
does not assume homoscedasticity, and in general has less stringent
requirements.</p><p>Compared with linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression has several
advantages:</p><ul><li>It is more robust: the independent variables don't have to be normally
   distributed, or have equal variance in each group</li><li>It does not assume a linear relationship between the independent
   variables and dependent variable.</li><li>It may handle nonlinear effects since one can add explicit interaction
   and power terms.</li></ul><p>However, it requires much more data to achieve stable, meaningful results.</p><p>Logistic regression also has strong connections with neural network and
maximum entropy modeling. For example, binary logistic regression is
equivalent to a one-layer, single-output neural network with a logistic
activation function trained under log loss. Similarly, multinomial logistic
regression is equivalent to a one-layer, softmax-output neural network.</p><p>Logistic regression estimation also obeys the maximum entropy principle, and
thus logistic regression is sometimes called &quot;maximum entropy modeling&quot;,
and the resulting classifier the &quot;maximum entropy classifier&quot;.

probability distributions from data. In maximum entropy models, the
observed data itself is assumed to be the testable information. Maximum
entropy models don't assume anything about the probability distribution
other than what have been observed and always choose the most uniform
distribution subject to the observed constraints.</p><p>Basically, maximum entropy classifier is another name of multinomial logistic
regression applied to categorical independent variables, which are
converted to binary dummy variables. Maximum entropy models are widely
used in natural language processing.  Here, we provide an implementation
which assumes that binary features are stored in a sparse array, of which
entries are the indices of nonzero features.</p><h6>References:</h6><ul><li>A. L. Berger, S. D. Pietra, and V. J. D. Pietra. A maximum entropy approach to natural language processing. Computational Linguistics 22(1):39-71, 1996.

      <p class="shortcomment cmt">Multilayer perceptron neural network.</p><div class="fullcomment"><div class="comment cmt"><p>Multilayer perceptron neural network.
An MLP consists of several layers of nodes, interconnected through weighted
acyclic arcs from each preceding layer to the following, without lateral or
feedback connections. Each node calculates a transformed weighted linear
combination of its inputs (output activations from the preceding layer), with
one of the weights acting as a trainable bias connected to a constant input.
The transformation, called activation function, is a bounded non-decreasing
(non-linear) function, such as the sigmoid functions (ranges from 0 to 1).
Another popular activation function is hyperbolic tangent which is actually
equivalent to the sigmoid function in shape but ranges from -1 to 1.
More specialized activation functions include radial basis functions which
are used in RBF networks.</p><p>The representational capabilities of a MLP are determined by the range of
mappings it may implement through weight variation. Single layer perceptrons
are capable of solving only linearly separable problems. With the sigmoid
function as activation function, the single-layer network is identical
to the logistic regression model.</p><p>The universal approximation theorem for neural networks states that every
continuous function that maps intervals of real numbers to some output
interval of real numbers can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a
multi-layer perceptron with just one hidden layer. This result holds only
for restricted classes of activation functions, which are extremely complex
and NOT smooth for subtle mathematical reasons. On the other hand, smoothness
is important for gradient descent learning. Besides, the proof is not
constructive regarding the number of neurons required or the settings of
the weights. Therefore, complex systems will have more layers of neurons
with some having increased layers of input neurons and output neurons
in practice.</p><p>The most popular algorithm to train MLPs is back-propagation, which is a
gradient descent method. Based on chain rule, the algorithm propagates the
error back through the network and adjusts the weights of each connection in
order to reduce the value of the error function by some small amount.
For this reason, back-propagation can only be applied on networks with
differentiable activation functions.</p><p>During error back propagation, we usually times the gradient with a small
number &eta;, called learning rate, which is carefully selected to ensure
that the network converges to a local minimum of the error function
fast enough, without producing oscillations. One way to avoid oscillation
at large &eta;, is to make the change in weight dependent on the past weight
change by adding a momentum term.</p><p>Although the back-propagation algorithm may performs gradient
descent on the total error of all instances in a batch way,
the learning rule is often applied to each instance separately in an online
way or stochastic way. There exists empirical indication that the stochastic
way results in faster convergence.</p><p>In practice, the problem of over-fitting has emerged. This arises in
convoluted or over-specified systems when the capacity of the network
significantly exceeds the needed free parameters. There are two general
approaches for avoiding this problem: The first is to use cross-validation
and similar techniques to check for the presence of over-fitting and
optimally select hyper-parameters such as to minimize the generalization
error. The second is to use some form of regularization, which emerges
naturally in a Bayesian framework, where the regularization can be
performed by selecting a larger prior probability over simpler models;
but also in statistical learning theory, where the goal is to minimize over
the &quot;empirical risk&quot; and the &quot;structural risk&quot;.</p><p>For neural networks, the input patterns usually should be scaled/standardized.
Commonly, each input variable is scaled into interval [0, 1] or to have
mean 0 and standard deviation 1.</p><p>For penalty functions and output units, the following natural pairings are
recommended:</p><ul><li>linear output units and a least squares penalty function.</li><li>a two-class cross-entropy penalty function and a logistic
   activation function.</li><li>a multi-class cross-entropy penalty function and a softmax
   activation function.</li></ul><p>By assigning a softmax activation function on the output layer of
the neural network for categorical target variables, the outputs
can be interpreted as posterior probabilities, which are very useful.

the classes is quadratic.</p><p>The Gaussian parameters for each class can be estimated from training data
with maximum likelihood (ML) estimation. However, when the number of

that consists of many decision trees and outputs the majority vote of
individual trees. The method combines bagging idea and the random
selection of features.</p><p>Each tree is constructed using the following algorithm:</p><ol class="lowerRoman"><li>If the number of cases in the training set is N, randomly sample N cases
with replacement from the original data. This sample will
be the training set for growing the tree.</li><li>If there are M input variables, a number m &lt;&lt; M is specified such
that at each node, m variables are selected at random out of the M and
the best split on these m is used to split the node. The value of m is
held constant during the forest growing.</li><li>Each tree is grown to the largest extent possible. There is no pruning.</li></ol><p>The advantages of random forest are:</p><ul><li>For many data sets, it produces a highly accurate classifier.</li><li>It runs efficiently on large data sets.</li><li>It can handle thousands of input variables without variable deletion.</li><li>It gives estimates of what variables are important in the classification.</li><li>It generates an internal unbiased estimate of the generalization error
as the forest building progresses.</li><li>It has an effective method for estimating missing data and maintains
accuracy when a large proportion of the data are missing.</li></ul><p>The disadvantages are</p><ul><li>Random forests are prone to over-fitting for some datasets. This is
even more pronounced on noisy data.</li><li>For data including categorical variables with different number of
levels, random forests are biased in favor of those attributes with more
levels. Therefore, the variable importance scores from random forest are
not reliable for this type of data.

      <p class="shortcomment cmt">Support vector machines for classification.</p><div class="fullcomment"><div class="comment cmt"><p>Support vector machines for classification. The basic support vector machine
is a binary linear classifier which chooses the hyperplane that represents
the largest separation, or margin, between the two classes. If such a
hyperplane exists, it is known as the maximum-margin hyperplane and the
linear classifier it defines is known as a maximum margin classifier.</p><p>If there exists no hyperplane that can perfectly split the positive and
negative instances, the soft margin method will choose a hyperplane
that splits the instances as cleanly as possible, while still maximizing
the distance to the nearest cleanly split instances.</p><p>The nonlinear SVMs are created by applying the kernel trick to
maximum-margin hyperplanes. The resulting algorithm is formally similar,
except that every dot product is replaced by a nonlinear kernel function.
This allows the algorithm to fit the maximum-margin hyperplane in a
transformed feature space. The transformation may be nonlinear and
the transformed space be high dimensional. For example, the feature space
corresponding Gaussian kernel is a Hilbert space of infinite dimension.
Thus though the classifier is a hyperplane in the high-dimensional feature
space, it may be nonlinear in the original input space. Maximum margin
classifiers are well regularized, so the infinite dimension does not spoil
the results.</p><p>The effectiveness of SVM depends on the selection of kernel, the kernel's
parameters, and soft margin parameter C. Given a kernel, best combination
of C and kernel's parameters is often selected by a grid-search with
cross validation.</p><p>The dominant approach for creating multi-class SVMs is to reduce the
single multi-class problem into multiple binary classification problems.
Common methods for such reduction is to build binary classifiers which
distinguish between (i) one of the labels to the rest (one-versus-all)
or (ii) between every pair of classes (one-versus-one). Classification
of new instances for one-versus-all case is done by a winner-takes-all
strategy, in which the classifier with the highest output function assigns
the class. For the one-versus-one approach, classification
is done by a max-wins voting strategy, in which every classifier assigns
the instance to one of the two classes, then the vote for the assigned
class is increased by one vote, and finally the class with most votes
determines the instance classification.
