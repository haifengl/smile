/**
 * The ordinal type allows for rank order (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) by which
 * data can be sorted, but still does not allow for relative degree of
 * difference between them. The psychological measurement, such as
 * measurement of opinions, usually operates on ordinal scales.
 * For example, 'completely agree', 'mostly agree', 'mostly disagree',
 * 'completely disagree' when measuring opinion.
 * <p>
 * The median, i.e. middle-ranked, item is allowed as the measure of
 * central tendency. But means and standard deviations have no validity.
 * In particular, IQ scores reflect an ordinal scale,
 * in which all scores are meaningful for comparison only. There is no
 * absolute zero, and a 10-point difference may carry different meanings
 * at different points of the scale.
