/**
 * A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search heuristic that mimics the process of
 * natural evolution. This heuristic is routinely used to generate useful
 * solutions to optimization and search problems. Genetic algorithms belong
 * to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA), which generate solutions
 * to optimization problems using techniques inspired by natural evolution,
 * such as inheritance, mutation, selection, and crossover.
 * <p>
 * In a genetic algorithm, a population of strings (called chromosomes), which
 * encode candidate solutions (called individuals) to an optimization problem,
 * evolves toward better solutions. Traditionally, solutions are represented in binary as strings
 * of 0s and 1s, but other encodings are also possible. The evolution usually
 * starts from a population of randomly generated individuals and happens in
 * generations. In each generation, the fitness of every individual in the
 * population is evaluated, multiple individuals are stochastically selected
 * from the current population (based on their fitness), and modified
 * (recombined and possibly randomly mutated) to form a new population. The
 * new population is then used in the next iteration of the algorithm. Commonly,
 * the algorithm terminates when either a maximum number of generations has been
 * produced, or a satisfactory fitness level has been reached for the population.
 * If the algorithm has terminated due to a maximum number of generations, a
 * satisfactory solution may or may not have been reached.
 * <p>
 * A typical genetic algorithm requires:
 * <ul>
 * <li> a genetic representation of the solution domain,
 * <li>a fitness function to evaluate the solution domain.
 * </ul>
 * A standard representation of the solution is as an array of bits. Arrays
 * of other types and structures can be used in essentially the same way.
 * The main property that makes these genetic representations convenient is
 * that their parts are easily aligned due to their fixed size, which
 * facilitates simple crossover operations. Variable length representations
 * may also be used, but crossover implementation is more complex in this case.
 * Tree-like representations are explored in genetic programming and graph-form
 * representations are explored in evolutionary programming.
 * <p>
 * The fitness function is defined over the genetic representation and measures
 * the quality of the represented solution. The fitness function is always
 * problem dependent.
 * <p>
 * Once we have the genetic representation and the fitness function defined,
 * GA proceeds to initialize a population of solutions randomly, then improve
 * it through repetitive application of selection, crossover and mutation operators.
 * <p>
 * Here are some basic recommendations of typical parameter values on binary
 * encoding based on empiric studies.
 * <dl>
 * <dt>Crossover Rate</dt>
 * <dd> Crossover rate determines how often will be crossover performed. If
 * there is no crossover, offspring is exact copy of parents. If there is a
 * crossover, offspring is made from parts of parents' chromosome. If crossover
 * rate is 100%, then all offspring is made by crossover. If it is 0%, whole
 * new generation is made from exact copies of chromosomes from old population.
 * However, it this does not mean that the new generation is the same because
 * of mutation. Crossover is made in hope that new chromosomes will have good
 * parts of old chromosomes and maybe the new chromosomes will be better.
 * However it is good to leave some part of population survive to next
 * generation. Crossover rate generally should be high, about 80% - 95%.
 * However some results show that for some problems crossover rate about 60% is
 * the best.</dd>
 * <dt>Mutation Rate</dt>
 * <dd> Mutation rate determines how often will be parts of chromosome mutated.
 * If there is no mutation, offspring is taken after crossover (or copy) without
 * any change. If mutation is performed, part of chromosome is changed.
 * Mutation is made to prevent falling GA into local extreme, but it should not
 * occur very often, because then GA will in fact change to random search.
 * Best rates reported are about 0.5% - 1%.</dd>
 * <dt>Population Size</dt>
 * <dd> Population size is the number of chromosomes in population (in one
 * generation). If there are too few chromosomes, GA have a few possibilities
 * to perform crossover and only a small part of search space is explored.
 * On the other hand, if there are too many chromosomes, GA slows down. Good
 * population size is about 20-30, however sometimes sizes 50-100 are reported
 * as best. Some research also shows, that best population size depends on
 * encoding, on size of encoded string.</dd>
 * <dt>Selection</dt>
 * <dd> Tournament selection has become the primary selection technique used for
 * the Genetic Algorithm. Basic roulette wheel selection can be used, but
 * sometimes rank selection can be better. In general, elitism should be used
 * unless other method is used to save the best found solution.</dd>
 * </dl>
 * This implementation also supports Lamarckian algorithm that is a hybrid
 * of evolutionary computation and a local improver such as hill-climbing.
 * Lamarckian algorithm augments an EA with some
 * hill-climbing during the fitness assessment phase to revise each individual
 * as it is being assessed. The revised individual replaces the original one
 * in the population.
 * <p>
 * The number of iterations t during each fitness assessment is a knob that
 * adjusts the degree of exploitation in the algorithm. If t is very large,
 * then we're doing more hill-climbing and thus more exploiting; whereas if
 * t is very small, then we're spending more time in the outer algorithm and
 * thus doing more exploring.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of <code>Chromosome</code>.
