 * A graph is an abstract representation of a set of objects where some pairs

 * represented by mathematical abstractions called vertices, and the links
 * that connect some pairs of vertices are called edges. The edges may be
 * directed (asymmetric) or undirected (symmetric). A graph is a weighted graph
 * if a number (weight) is assigned to each edge. Such weights might represent,
 * for example, costs, lengths or capacities, etc. depending on the problem.
