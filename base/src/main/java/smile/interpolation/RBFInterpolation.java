/**
 * Radial basis function interpolation is a popular method for the data points
 * are irregularly distributed in space. In its basic form, radial basis
 * function interpolation is in the form
 * <p>
 *     y(x) = &Sigma; w<sub>i</sub> &phi;(||x-c<sub>i</sub>||)
 * <p>
 * where the approximating function y(x) is represented as a sum of N radial
 * basis functions &phi;, each associated with a different center c<sub>i</sub>,
 * and weighted by an appropriate coefficient w<sub>i</sub>. For distance,
 * one usually chooses Euclidean distance. The weights w<sub>i</sub> can
 * be estimated using the matrix methods of linear least squares, because
 * the approximating function is linear in the weights.
 * <p>
 * The points c<sub>i</sub> often called the centers or collocation points
 * of the RBF interpolant. Note also that the centers c<sub>i</sub> can be
 * located at arbitrary points in the domain, and do not require a grid.
 * For certain RBF exponential convergence has been shown. Radial basis
 * functions were successfully applied to problems as diverse as computer
 * graphics, neural networks, for the solution of differential equations
 * via collocation methods and many other problems.
 * <p>
 * Other popular choices for &phi; comprise the Gaussian function and the
 * so-called thin plate splines. Thin plate splines result from the solution of
 * a variational problem. The advantage of the thin plate splines is that
 * their conditioning is invariant under scaling. Gaussians, multi-quadrics
 * and inverse multi-quadrics are infinitely smooth and involve a scale
 * or shape parameter, r<sub><small>0</small></sub> {@code > 0}.
 * Decreasing r<sub><small>0</small></sub> tends to
 * flatten the basis function. For a given function, the quality of
 * approximation may strongly depend on this parameter. In particular,
 * increasing r<sub><small>0</small></sub> has the effect of better conditioning
 * (the separation distance  of the scaled points increases).
 * <p>
 * A variant on RBF interpolation is normalized radial basis function (NRBF)
 * interpolation, in which we require the sum of the basis functions to be unity.
 * NRBF arises more naturally from a Bayesian statistical perspective. However,
 * there is no evidence that either the NRBF method is consistently superior
 * to the RBF method, or vice versa.
