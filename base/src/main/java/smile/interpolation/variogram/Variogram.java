/**
 * In spatial statistics the theoretical variogram
 * <code>2&gamma;(x,y)</code> is a function describing the degree
 * of spatial dependence of a spatial random field or stochastic process
 * <code>Z(x)</code>. It is defined as the expected squared increment
 * of the values between locations x and y:
 * <p>
 *     2&gamma;(x,y) = E(|Z(x)-Z(y)|<sup>2</sup>)
 * <p>
 * where <code>&gamma;(x,y)</code> itself is called the semivariogram.
 * In case of a stationary process the variogram and semivariogram can be
 * represented as a function
 * <code>&gamma;<sub>s</sub>(h) = &gamma;(0, 0 + h)</code> of the difference
 * <code>h = y - x</code> between locations only, by the following relation:
 * <p>
 *     &gamma;(x,y) = &gamma;<sub>s</sub>(y - x).
 * <p>
 * In Kriging interpolation or Gaussian process regression, we employ this kind
 * of variogram as an estimation of the mean square variation of the
 * interpolation/fitting function. For interpolation, even very crude
 * variogram estimate works fine.
 * <p>
 * The variogram characterizes the spatial continuity or roughness of a data set.
 * Ordinary one dimensional statistics for two data sets may be nearly identical,
 * but the spatial continuity may be quite different. Variogram analysis consists
 * of the experimental variogram calculated from the data and the variogram model
 * fitted to the data. The experimental variogram is calculated by averaging one half
 * the difference squared of the z-values over all pairs of observations with the
 * specified separation distance and direction. It is plotted as a two-dimensional
 * graph. The variogram model is chosen from a set of mathematical functions that
 * describe spatial relationships. The appropriate model is chosen by matching
 * the shape of the curve of the experimental variogram to the shape of the curve
 * of the mathematical function.
