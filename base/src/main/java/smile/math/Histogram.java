/**
 * Histogram utilities. A histogram is a graphical display of tabulated
 * frequencies, shown as bars. It shows what proportion of cases fall into
 * each of several categories: it is a form of data binning. The categories
 * are usually specified as non-overlapping intervals of some variable.
 * <p>
 * There is no "best" number of bins, and different bin sizes can reveal
 * different features of the data. Depending on the actual data distribution
 * and the goals of the analysis, different bin widths may be appropriate,
 * so experimentation is usually needed to determine an appropriate width.
 * <p>
 * Note that this class provides only tools to choose the bin width or the
 * number of bins and frequency counting. It does NOT provide plotting
 * services.
