/**
 * The Jaccard index, also known as the Jaccard similarity coefficient is a
 * statistic used for comparing the similarity and diversity of sample sets.
 * <p>
 * The Jaccard coefficient measures similarity between sample sets, and is
 * defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union
 * of the sample sets.
 * <p>
 * The Jaccard distance, which measures dissimilarity between sample sets,
 * is complementary to the Jaccard coefficient and is obtained by subtracting
 * the Jaccard coefficient from 1, or, equivalently, by dividing the difference
 * of the sizes of the union and the intersection of two sets by the size of
 * the union.
 *
 * @param <T> the input type of distance function.
