/**
 * A metric function defines a distance between elements of a set. Besides
 * non-negativity, isolation, and symmetry, it also has to satisfy triangular
 * inequality.
 * <ul>
 * <li> non-negativity: {@code d(x, y) >= 0}
 * <li> isolation: {@code d(x, y) = 0} if and only if {@code x = y}
 * <li> symmetry: {@code d(x, y) = d(x, y)}
 * <li> triangular inequality: {@code |x - y| + |y - z| >= |x - z|}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param <T> the input type of metric function.
