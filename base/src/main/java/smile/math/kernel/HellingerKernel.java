 * The Hellinger kernel. The Hellinger distance is used to quantify the

 * f-divergence. The Hellinger distance H(P, Q) on discrete distributions
 * is equivalent to the Euclidean distance of the square root vectors.
 * The Hellinger kernel is 1 - H<sup>2</sup>(P, Q), which is equivalent
 * to the dot product of the square root vectors.
