/**
 * The hyperbolic tangent kernel on sparse data.
 * <p>
 *     k(u, v) = tanh(&gamma; u<sup>T</sup>v - &lambda;)
 * <p>
 * where &gamma; is the scale of the used inner product and &lambda; is
 * the offset of the used inner product. If the offset is negative the
 * likelihood of obtaining a kernel matrix that is not positive definite
 * is much higher (since then even some diagonal elements may be negative),
 * hence if this kernel has to be used, the offset should always be positive.
 * Note, however, that this is no guarantee that the kernel will be positive.
 * <p>
 * The hyperbolic tangent kernel was quite popular for support vector machines
 * due to its origin from neural networks. However, it should be used carefully
 * since the kernel matrix may not be positive semi-definite. Besides, it was
 * reported the hyperbolic tangent kernel is not better than the Gaussian kernel
 * in general.
