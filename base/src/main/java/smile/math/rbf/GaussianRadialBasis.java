/**
 * Gaussian RBF. &phi;(r) = exp(-0.5 * r<sup>2</sup> / r<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>)
 * where r<sub>0</sub> is a scale factor. The interpolation accuracy using
 * Gaussian basis functions can be very sensitive to r<sub>0</sub>, and they
 * are often avoided for this reason. However, for smooth functions and with
 * an optimal r<sub>0</sub>, very high accuracy can be achieved. The Gaussian
 * also will extrapolate any function to zero far from the data, and it gets
 * to zero quickly.
 * <p>
 * In general, r<sub>0</sub> should be larger than the typical separation of
 * points but smaller than the "outer scale" or feature size of the function
 * to interplate. There can be several orders of magnitude difference between
 * the interpolation accuracy with a good choice for r<sub>0</sub>, versus a
 * poor choice, so it is definitely worth some experimentation. One way to
 * experiment is to construct an RBF interpolator omitting one data point
 * at a time and measuring the interpolation error at the omitted point.
