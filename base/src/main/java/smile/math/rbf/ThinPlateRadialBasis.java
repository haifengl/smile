/**
 * Thin plate RBF. &phi;(r) = r<sup>2</sup> log(r / r<sub>0</sub>)
 * with the limiting value &phi;(0)=0 assumed, where r<sub>0</sub> is a scale factor.
 * This function has some physical justification in the energy minimization
 * problem associated with warping a thin elastic plate. However, there is no
 * indication that it is generally better than multiquadric or inverse
 * multiquadric function.
 * <p>
 * In general, r<sub>0</sub> should be larger than the typical separation of
 * points but smaller than the "outer scale" or feature size of the function
 * to interplate. There can be several orders of magnitude difference between
 * the interpolation accuracy with a good choice for r<sub>0</sub>, versus a
 * poor choice, so it is definitely worth some experimentation. One way to
 * experiment is to construct an RBF interpolator omitting one data point
 * at a time and measuring the interpolation error at the omitted point.
