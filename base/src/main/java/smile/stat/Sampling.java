     * Latin hypercube sampling. LHS generates a near-random sample of
     * parameter values from a multidimensional distribution. The sampling
     * method is often used to construct Monte Carlo simulation.
     * <p>
     * A Latin hypercube is an n-by-d matrix, each column of which is a
     * permutation of 1, 2, ..., n. When sampling a function of d variables,
     * the range of each variable is divided into n equally probable intervals.
     * n sample points are then placed to satisfy the Latin hypercube
     * requirements; this forces the number of divisions, n, to be equal for
     * each variable.
     * <p>
     * This sampling scheme does not require more samples for more dimensions
     * (variables); this independence is one of the main advantages of this
     * sampling scheme. Another advantage is that random samples can be taken
     * one at a time, remembering which samples were taken so far.
     * <p>
     * Because the component samples are randomly paired, an LHS is not unique;
     * there are (d!)<sup>n-1</sup> possible combinations. With this in mind,
     * improved LHS algorithms iterate to determine optimal pairings according
     * to some specified criteria - such as reduced correlation among the terms
     * or enhanced space-filling properties.
     * <p>
     * A randomly generated Latin Hypercube may be quite structured: the design
     * may not have good univariate projection uniformity or the different
     * columns might be highly correlated. Several criteria such as maximin
     * distance and minimum correlation have been proposed to address these
     * issues.
     *
     * @param n the number of divisions, also the number of samples.
     * @param d the dimensionality, i.e. the number of variables.
     * @return Latin hypercube of n-by-d matrix.
