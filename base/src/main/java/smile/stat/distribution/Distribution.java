 * Probability distribution of univariate random variable. A probability

 * variable (when the variable is discrete), or the probability of the value
 * falling within a particular interval (when the variable is continuous).
 * When the random variable takes values in the set of real numbers, the
 * probability distribution is completely described by the cumulative
 * distribution function, whose value at each real x is the probability
 * that the random variable is smaller than or equal to x.
 * <p>
 * Both rejection and inverse transform sampling methods are implemented to
 * provide some general approaches to generate random samples based on
 * probability density function or quantile function. Besides, a quantile
 * function is also provided based on bisection searching.

     * function f(x) by using an instrumental distribution g(x), under the
     * only restriction that {@code f(x) < M g(x)} where
     * {@code M > 1} is an appropriate bound on
     * {@code f(x) / g(x)}.
     * <p>
     * Rejection sampling is usually used in cases where the form of
     * <code>f(x)</code> makes sampling difficult. Instead of sampling
     * directly from the distribution <code>f(x)</code>, we use an envelope
     * distribution <code>M g(x)</code> where sampling is easier. These
     * samples from <code>M g(x)</code> are probabilistically
     * accepted or rejected.
     * <p>
     * This method relates to the general field of Monte Carlo techniques,
     * including Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms that also use a proxy
     * distribution to achieve simulation from the target distribution
     * <code>f(x)</code>. It forms the basis for algorithms such as
