/**
 * Negative binomial distribution arises as the probability distribution of
 * the number of successes in a series of independent and identically distributed
 * Bernoulli trials needed to get a specified (non-random) number r of failures.
 * If r is an integer, it is usually called Pascal distribution. Otherwise, it
 * is often called Polya distribution for the real-valued case. When r = 1 we
 * get the probability distribution of number of successes before the
 * first failure, which is a geometric distribution.
 * <p>
 * An alternative definition is that X is the total number of trials needed
 * to get r failures, not simply the number of successes. This alternative
 * parameterization can be used as an alternative to the Poisson distribution.
 * It is especially useful for discrete data over an unbounded positive range
 * whose sample variance exceeds the sample mean. If a Poisson distribution is
 * used to model such data, the model mean and variance are equal. In that case,
 * the observations are overdispersed with respect to the Poisson model.
 * Since the negative binomial distribution has one more parameter than the
 * Poisson, the second parameter can be used to adjust the variance
 * independently of the mean. In the case of modest overdispersion, this may
 * produce substantially similar results to an overdispersed Poisson distribution.
 * <p>
 * The negative binomial distribution also arises as a continuous mixture
 * of Poisson distributions where the mixing distribution of the Poisson rate
 * is a gamma distribution. That is, we can view the negative binomial as a
 * Poisson(&lambda;) distribution, where &lambda; is itself a random variable,
 * distributed according to &Gamma;(r, p/(1 - p)).
