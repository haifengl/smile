/**
 * The Cholesky decomposition of a symmetric, positive-definite matrix.
 * When it is applicable, the Cholesky decomposition is roughly twice as
 * efficient as the LU decomposition for solving systems of linear equations.
 * <p>
 * The Cholesky decomposition is mainly used for the numerical solution of
 * linear equations. The Cholesky decomposition is also commonly used in
 * the Monte Carlo method for simulating systems with multiple correlated
 * variables: The matrix of inter-variable correlations is decomposed,
 * to give the lower-triangular L. Applying this to a vector of uncorrelated
 * simulated shocks, u, produces a shock vector Lu with the covariance
 * properties of the system being modeled.
 * <p>
 * Unscented Kalman filters commonly use the Cholesky decomposition to choose
 * a set of so-called sigma points. The Kalman filter tracks the average
 * state of a system as a vector x of length n and covariance as an n-by-n
 * matrix P. The matrix P is always positive semi-definite, and can be
 * decomposed into L*L'. The columns of L can be added and subtracted from
 * the mean x to form a set of 2n vectors called sigma points. These sigma
 * points completely capture the mean and covariance of the system state.
 *
 * @param lu the Cholesky factorization.
