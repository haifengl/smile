/**
 * Eigenvalue decomposition. Eigen decomposition is the factorization
 * of a matrix into a canonical form, whereby the matrix is represented in terms
 * of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors:
 * <pre>{@code
 *     A = V*D*V<sup>-1</sup>
 * }</pre>
 * If A is symmetric, then A = V*D*V' where the eigenvalue matrix D is
 * diagonal and the eigenvector matrix V is orthogonal.
 * <p>
 * Given a linear transformation A, a non-zero vector x is defined to be an
 * eigenvector of the transformation if it satisfies the eigenvalue equation
 * <pre>{@code
 *     A x = &lambda; x
 * }</pre>
 * for some scalar &lambda;. In this situation, the scalar &lambda; is called
 * an eigenvalue of A corresponding to the eigenvector x.
 * <p>
 * The word eigenvector formally refers to the right eigenvector, which is
 * defined by the above eigenvalue equation A x = &lambda; x, and is the most
 * commonly used eigenvector. However, the left eigenvector exists as well, and
 * is defined by x A = &lambda; x.
 * <p>
 * Let A be a real n-by-n matrix with strictly positive entries a<sub>ij</sub>
 * {@code > 0}. Then the following statements hold.
 * <ol>
 * <li> There is a positive real number r, called the Perron-Frobenius
 * eigenvalue, such that r is an eigenvalue of A and any other eigenvalue &lambda;
 * (possibly complex) is strictly smaller than r in absolute value,
 * |&lambda;| {@code < r}.
 * <li> The Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue is simple: r is a simple root of the
 *      characteristic polynomial of A. Consequently, both the right and the left
 *      eigenspace associated to r is one-dimensional.
 * </li>
 * <li> There exists a left eigenvector v of A associated with r (row vector)
 *      having strictly positive components. Likewise, there exists a right
 *      eigenvector w associated with r (column vector) having strictly positive
 *      components.
 * </li>
 * <li> The left eigenvector v (respectively right w) associated with r, is the
 *      only eigenvector which has positive components, i.e. for all other
 *      eigenvectors of A there exists a component which is not positive.
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * A stochastic matrix, probability matrix, or transition matrix is used to
 * describe the transitions of a Markov chain. A right stochastic matrix is
 * a square matrix each of whose rows consists of non-negative real numbers,
 * with each row summing to 1. A left stochastic matrix is a square matrix
 * whose columns consist of non-negative real numbers whose sum is 1. A doubly
 * stochastic matrix where all entries are non-negative and all rows and all
 * columns sum to 1. A stationary probability vector &pi; is defined as a
 * vector that does not change under application of the transition matrix;
 * that is, it is defined as a left eigenvector of the probability matrix,
 * associated with eigenvalue 1: &pi;P = &pi;. The Perron-Frobenius theorem
 * ensures that such a vector exists, and that the largest eigenvalue
 * associated with a stochastic matrix is always 1. For a matrix with strictly
 * positive entries, this vector is unique. In general, however, there may be
 * several such vectors.
