 * system A * x = b since the rate of convergence for most iterative
 * linear solvers increases because the condition number of a matrix
 * decreases as a result of preconditioning. Preconditioned iterative
 * solvers typically outperform direct solvers for large, especially
 * for sparse matrices.
 * <p>
 * The preconditioner matrix P is close to A and should be easy to
 * solve for linear systems. The preconditioner matrix could be as
 * simple as the trivial diagonal part of A in some cases.
