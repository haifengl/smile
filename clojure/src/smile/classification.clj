(defn logit
  "Logistic regression.

  Logistic regression (logit model) is a generalized linear model used for
  binomial regression. Logistic regression applies maximum likelihood
  estimation after transforming the dependent into a logit variable.
  A logit is the natural log of the odds of the dependent equaling a
  certain value or not (usually 1 in binary logistic models, the highest
  value in multinomial models). In this way, logistic regression
  estimates the odds of a certain event (value) occurring.

  Goodness-of-fit tests such as the likelihood ratio test are available
  as indicators of model appropriateness, as is the Wald statistic to test
  the significance of individual independent variables.

  Logistic regression has many analogies to ordinary least squares (OLS)
  regression. Unlike OLS regression, however, logistic regression does not
  assume linearity of relationship between the raw values of the independent
  variables and the dependent, does not require normally distributed variables,
  does not assume homoscedasticity, and in general has less stringent
  requirements.

  Compared with linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression has several
  advantages:

   - It is more robust: the independent variables don't have to be normally
     distributed, or have equal variance in each group

   - It does not assume a linear relationship between the independent
     variables and dependent variable.

   - It may handle nonlinear effects since one can add explicit interaction
     and power terms.

  However, it requires much more data to achieve stable, meaningful results.

  Logistic regression also has strong connections with neural network and
  maximum entropy modeling. For example, binary logistic regression is
  equivalent to a one-layer, single-output neural network with a logistic
  activation function trained under log loss. Similarly, multinomial logistic
  regression is equivalent to a one-layer, softmax-output neural network.

  Logistic regression estimation also obeys the maximum entropy principle, and
  thus logistic regression is sometimes called 'maximum entropy modeling',
  and the resulting classifier the 'maximum entropy classifier'.

  `x` is the training samples.
  `y` is the training labels in `[0, k)`, where `k` is the number of classes.

(defn maxent
  "Maximum Entropy classifier.

  Maximum entropy is a technique for learning probability distributions
  from data. In maximum entropy models, the observed data itself is assumed
  to be the testable information. Maximum entropy models don't assume
  anything about the probability distribution other than what have been
  observed and always choose the most uniform distribution subject to
  the observed constraints.

  Basically, maximum entropy classifier is another name of multinomial logistic
  regression applied to categorical independent variables, which are
  converted to binary dummy variables. Maximum entropy models are widely
  used in natural language processing.  Here, we provide an implementation
  which assumes that binary features are stored in a sparse array, of which
  entries are the indices of nonzero features.

  `x` is the training samples. Each sample is represented by a set of sparse
  binary features. The features are stored in an integer array, of which

(defn mlp
  "Multilayer perceptron neural network.

  An MLP consists of several layers of nodes, interconnected through weighted
  acyclic arcs from each preceding layer to the following, without lateral or
  feedback connections. Each node calculates a transformed weighted linear
  combination of its inputs (output activations from the preceding layer), with
  one of the weights acting as a trainable bias connected to a constant input.
  The transformation, called activation function, is a bounded non-decreasing
  (non-linear) function, such as the sigmoid functions (ranges from 0 to 1).
  Another popular activation function is hyperbolic tangent which is actually
  equivalent to the sigmoid function in shape but ranges from -1 to 1.
  More specialized activation functions include radial basis functions which
  are used in RBF networks.

  The representational capabilities of a MLP are determined by the range of
  mappings it may implement through weight variation. Single layer perceptrons
  are capable of solving only linearly separable problems. With the sigmoid
  function as activation function, the single-layer network is identical
  to the logistic regression model.

  The universal approximation theorem for neural networks states that every
  continuous function that maps intervals of real numbers to some output
  interval of real numbers can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a
  multi-layer perceptron with just one hidden layer. This result holds only
  for restricted classes of activation functions, which are extremely complex
  and NOT smooth for subtle mathematical reasons. On the other hand, smoothness
  is important for gradient descent learning. Besides, the proof is not
  constructive regarding the number of neurons required or the settings of
  the weights. Therefore, complex systems will have more layers of neurons
  with some having increased layers of input neurons and output neurons
  in practice.

  The most popular algorithm to train MLPs is back-propagation, which is a
  gradient descent method. Based on chain rule, the algorithm propagates the
  error back through the network and adjusts the weights of each connection in
  order to reduce the value of the error function by some small amount.
  For this reason, back-propagation can only be applied on networks with
  differentiable activation functions.

  During error back propagation, we usually times the gradient with a small
  number &eta;, called learning rate, which is carefully selected to ensure
  that the network converges to a local minimum of the error function
  fast enough, without producing oscillations. One way to avoid oscillation
  at large &eta;, is to make the change in weight dependent on the past weight
  change by adding a momentum term.

  Although the back-propagation algorithm may performs gradient
  descent on the total error of all instances in a batch way,
  the learning rule is often applied to each instance separately in an online
  way or stochastic way. There exists empirical indication that the stochastic
  way results in faster convergence.

  In practice, the problem of over-fitting has emerged. This arises in
  convoluted or over-specified systems when the capacity of the network
  significantly exceeds the needed free parameters. There are two general
  approaches for avoiding this problem: The first is to use cross-validation
  and similar techniques to check for the presence of over-fitting and
  optimally select hyperparameters such as to minimize the generalization
  error. The second is to use some form of regularization, which emerges
  naturally in a Bayesian framework, where the regularization can be
  performed by selecting a larger prior probability over simpler models;
  but also in statistical learning theory, where the goal is to minimize over
  the 'empirical risk' and the 'structural risk'.

  For neural networks, the input patterns usually should be
  scaled/standardized. Commonly, each input variable is scaled into
  interval `[0, 1]` or to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1.

  For penalty functions and output units, the following natural pairings are
  recommended:

   - linear output units and a least squares penalty function.
   - a two-class cross-entropy penalty function and a logistic
     activation function.
   - a multi-class cross-entropy penalty function and a softmax
     activation function.

  By assigning a softmax activation function on the output layer of
  the neural network for categorical target variables, the outputs
  can be interpreted as posterior probabilities, which are very useful.

(defn rbfnet
  "Radial basis function networks.

  A radial basis function network is an artificial neural network that uses
  radial basis functions as activation functions. It is a linear combination
  of radial basis functions. They are used in function approximation, time
  series prediction, and control.

  In its basic form, radial basis function network is in the form
  ```
  y(x) = &Sigma; w<sub>i</sub> &phi;(||x-c<sub>i</sub>||)
  ```
  where the approximating function y(x) is represented as a sum of N radial
  basis functions &phi;, each associated with a different center c<sub>i</sub>,
  and weighted by an appropriate coefficient w<sub>i</sub>. For distance,
  one usually chooses Euclidean distance. The weights w<sub>i</sub> can
  be estimated using the matrix methods of linear least squares, because
  the approximating function is linear in the weights.

  The centers c<sub>i</sub> can be randomly selected from training data,
  or learned by some clustering method (e.g. k-means), or learned together
  with weight parameters undergo a supervised learning processing
  (e.g. error-correction learning).

  The popular choices for &phi; comprise the Gaussian function and the so
  called thin plate splines. The advantage of the thin plate splines is that
  their conditioning is invariant under scalings. Gaussian, multi-quadric
  and inverse multi-quadric are infinitely smooth and and involve a scale
  or shape parameter, r<sub><small>0</small></sub> &gt; 0. Decreasing
  r<sub><small>0</small></sub> tends to flatten the basis function. For a
  given function, the quality of approximation may strongly depend on this
  parameter. In particular, increasing r<sub><small>0</small></sub> has the
  effect of better conditioning (the separation distance of the scaled points
  increases).

  A variant on RBF networks is normalized radial basis function (NRBF)
  networks, in which we require the sum of the basis functions to be unity.
  NRBF arises more naturally from a Bayesian statistical perspective. However,
  there is no evidence that either the NRBF method is consistently superior
  to the RBF method, or vice versa.

  SVMs with Gaussian kernel have similar structure as RBF networks with
  Gaussian radial basis functions. However, the SVM approach 'automatically'
  solves the network complexity problem since the size of the hidden layer
  is obtained as the result of the QP procedure. Hidden neurons and
  support vectors correspond to each other, so the center problems of
  the RBF network is also solved, as the support vectors serve as the
  basis function centers. It was reported that with similar number of support
  vectors/centers, SVM shows better generalization performance than RBF
  network when the training data size is relatively small. On the other hand,
  RBF network gives better generalization performance than SVM on large
  training data.

(defn svm
  "Support vector machine.

  The basic support vector machine is a binary linear classifier which
  chooses the hyperplane that represents the largest separation, or margin,
  between the two classes. If such a hyperplane exists, it is known as the
  maximum-margin hyperplane and the linear classifier it defines is known
  as a maximum margin classifier.

  If there exists no hyperplane that can perfectly split the positive and
  negative instances, the soft margin method will choose a hyperplane
  that splits the instances as cleanly as possible, while still maximizing
  the distance to the nearest cleanly split instances.

  The nonlinear SVMs are created by applying the kernel trick to
  maximum-margin hyperplanes. The resulting algorithm is formally similar,
  except that every dot product is replaced by a nonlinear kernel function.
  This allows the algorithm to fit the maximum-margin hyperplane in a
  transformed feature space. The transformation may be nonlinear and
  the transformed space be high dimensional. For example, the feature space
  corresponding Gaussian kernel is a Hilbert space of infinite dimension.
  Thus though the classifier is a hyperplane in the high-dimensional feature
  space, it may be nonlinear in the original input space. Maximum margin
  classifiers are well regularized, so the infinite dimension does not spoil
  the results.

  The effectiveness of SVM depends on the selection of kernel, the kernel's
  parameters, and soft margin parameter C. Given a kernel, best combination
  of C and kernel's parameters is often selected by a grid-search with
  cross validation.

  The dominant approach for creating multi-class SVMs is to reduce the
  single multi-class problem into multiple binary classification problems.
  Common methods for such reduction is to build binary classifiers which
  distinguish between (i) one of the labels to the rest (one-versus-all)
  or (ii) between every pair of classes (one-versus-one). Classification
  of new instances for one-versus-all case is done by a winner-takes-all
  strategy, in which the classifier with the highest output function assigns
  the class. For the one-versus-one approach, classification
  is done by a max-wins voting strategy, in which every classifier assigns
  the instance to one of the two classes, then the vote for the assigned
  class is increased by one vote, and finally the class with most votes
  determines the instance classification.

(defn cart
  "Decision tree.

  A classification/regression tree can be learned by splitting the training
  set into subsets based on an attribute value test. This process is repeated
  on each derived subset in a recursive manner called recursive partitioning.
  The recursion is completed when the subset at a node all has the same value
  of the target variable, or when splitting no longer adds value to the
  predictions.

  The algorithms that are used for constructing decision trees usually
  work top-down by choosing a variable at each step that is the next best
  variable to use in splitting the set of items. 'Best' is defined by how
  well the variable splits the set into homogeneous subsets that have
  the same value of the target variable. Different algorithms use different
  formulae for measuring 'best'. Used by the CART algorithm, Gini impurity
  is a measure of how often a randomly chosen element from the set would
  be incorrectly labeled if it were randomly labeled according to the
  distribution of labels in the subset. Gini impurity can be computed by
  summing the probability of each item being chosen times the probability
  of a mistake in categorizing that item. It reaches its minimum (zero) when
  all cases in the node fall into a single target category. Information gain
  is another popular measure, used by the ID3, C4.5 and C5.0 algorithms.
  Information gain is based on the concept of entropy used in information
  theory. For categorical variables with different number of levels, however,
  information gain are biased in favor of those attributes with more levels.
  Instead, one may employ the information gain ratio, which solves the drawback
  of information gain.

  Classification and Regression Tree techniques have a number of advantages
  over many of those alternative techniques.
   - Simple to understand and interpret:
  In most cases, the interpretation of results summarized in a tree is
  very simple. This simplicity is useful not only for purposes of rapid
  classification of new observations, but can also often yield a much simpler
  'model' for explaining why observations are classified or predicted in a
  particular manner.
   - Able to handle both numerical and categorical data:
  Other techniques are usually specialized in analyzing datasets that
  have only one type of variable.
   - Nonparametric and nonlinear:
  The final results of using tree methods for classification or regression
  can be summarized in a series of (usually few) logical if-then conditions
  (tree nodes). Therefore, there is no implicit assumption that the underlying
  relationships between the predictor variables and the dependent variable
  are linear, follow some specific non-linear link function, or that they
  are even monotonic in nature. Thus, tree methods are particularly well
  suited for data mining tasks, where there is often little a priori
  knowledge nor any coherent set of theories or predictions regarding which
  variables are related and how. In those types of data analytics, tree
  methods can often reveal simple relationships between just a few variables
  that could have easily gone unnoticed using other analytic techniques.

  One major problem with classification and regression trees is their high
  variance. Often a small change in the data can result in a very different
  series of splits, making interpretation somewhat precarious. Besides,
  decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that cause over-fitting.
  Mechanisms such as pruning are necessary to avoid this problem.
  Another limitation of trees is the lack of smoothness of the prediction
  surface.

  Some techniques such as bagging, boosting, and random forest use more than
  one decision tree for their analysis.

(defn random-forest
  "Random forest.

  Random forest is an ensemble classifier that consists of many decision
  trees and outputs the majority vote of individual trees. The method
  combines bagging idea and the random selection of features.

  Each tree is constructed using the following algorithm:

   1. If the number of cases in the training set is N, randomly sample N cases
  with replacement from the original data. This sample will
  be the training set for growing the tree.
   2. If there are M input variables, a number m &lt;&lt; M is specified such
  that at each node, m variables are selected at random out of the M and
  the best split on these m is used to split the node. The value of m is
  held constant during the forest growing.
   3. Each tree is grown to the largest extent possible. There is no pruning.

  The advantages of random forest are:

   - For many data sets, it produces a highly accurate classifier.
   - It runs efficiently on large data sets.
   - It can handle thousands of input variables without variable deletion.
   - It gives estimates of what variables are important in the classification.
   - It generates an internal unbiased estimate of the generalization error
  as the forest building progresses.
   - It has an effective method for estimating missing data and maintains
  accuracy when a large proportion of the data are missing.

  The disadvantages are

   - Random forests are prone to over-fitting for some datasets. This is
  even more pronounced on noisy data.
   - For data including categorical variables with different number of
  levels, random forests are biased in favor of those attributes with more
  levels. Therefore, the variable importance scores from random forest are
  not reliable for this type of data.

(defn gbm 
  "Gradient boosted classification trees.

  Generic gradient boosting at the t-th step would fit a regression tree to
  pseudo-residuals. Let J be the number of its leaves. The tree partitions
  the input space into J disjoint regions and predicts a constant value in
  each region. The parameter J controls the maximum allowed
  level of interaction between variables in the model. With J = 2 (decision
  stumps), no interaction between variables is allowed. With J = 3 the model
  may include effects of the interaction between up to two variables, and
  so on. Hastie et al. comment that typically 4 &le; J &le; 8 work well
  for boosting and results are fairly insensitive to the choice of in
  this range, J = 2 is insufficient for many applications, and J &gt; 10 is
  unlikely to be required.

  Fitting the training set too closely can lead to degradation of the model's
  generalization ability. Several so-called regularization techniques reduce
  this over-fitting effect by constraining the fitting procedure.
  One natural regularization parameter is the number of gradient boosting
  iterations T (i.e. the number of trees in the model when the base learner
  is a decision tree). Increasing T reduces the error on training set,
  but setting it too high may lead to over-fitting. An optimal value of T
  is often selected by monitoring prediction error on a separate validation
  data set.

  Another regularization approach is the shrinkage which times a parameter
  &eta; (called the 'learning rate') to update term.
  Empirically it has been found that using small learning rates (such as
  &eta; &lt; 0.1) yields dramatic improvements in model's generalization ability
  over gradient boosting without shrinking (&eta; = 1). However, it comes at
  the price of increasing computational time both during training and
  prediction: lower learning rate requires more iterations.

  Soon after the introduction of gradient boosting Friedman proposed a
  minor modification to the algorithm, motivated by Breiman's bagging method.
  Specifically, he proposed that at each iteration of the algorithm, a base
  learner should be fit on a subsample of the training set drawn at random
  without replacement. Friedman observed a substantial improvement in
  gradient boosting's accuracy with this modification.

  Subsample size is some constant fraction f of the size of the training set.
  When f = 1, the algorithm is deterministic and identical to the one
  described above. Smaller values of f introduce randomness into the
  algorithm and help prevent over-fitting, acting as a kind of regularization.
  The algorithm also becomes faster, because regression trees have to be fit
  to smaller datasets at each iteration. Typically, f is set to 0.5, meaning
  that one half of the training set is used to build each base learner.

  Also, like in bagging, sub-sampling allows one to define an out-of-bag
  estimate of the prediction performance improvement by evaluating predictions
  on those observations which were not used in the building of the next
  base learner. Out-of-bag estimates help avoid the need for an independent
  validation dataset, but often underestimate actual performance improvement
  and the optimal number of iterations.

  Gradient tree boosting implementations often also use regularization by
  limiting the minimum number of observations in trees' terminal nodes.
  It's used in the tree building process by ignoring any splits that lead
  to nodes containing fewer than this number of training set instances.
  Imposing this limit helps to reduce variance in predictions at leaves.

  "Adaptive boosting.

  In principle, AdaBoost is a meta-algorithm, and can be used in conjunction
  with many other learning algorithms to improve their performance. In
  practice, AdaBoost with decision trees is probably the most popular
  combination. AdaBoost is adaptive in the sense that subsequent classifiers
  built are tweaked in favor of those instances misclassified by previous
  classifiers. AdaBoost is sensitive to noisy data and outliers. However
  in some problems it can be less susceptible to the over-fitting problem
  than most learning algorithms.

  AdaBoost calls a weak classifier repeatedly in a series of rounds from
  total T classifiers. For each call a distribution of weights is updated
  that indicates the importance of examples in the data set for the
  classification. On each round, the weights of each incorrectly classified
  example are increased (or alternatively, the weights of each correctly
  classified example are decreased), so that the new classifier focuses more
  on those examples.

  The basic AdaBoost algorithm is only for binary classification problem.
  For multi-class classification, a common approach is reducing the
  multi-class classification problem to multiple two-class problems.
  This implementation is a multi-class AdaBoost without such reductions.

  "Fisher's linear discriminant.

  Fisher's linear discriminant. Fisher defined the separation between two
  distributions to be the ratio of the variance between the classes to
  the variance within the classes, which is, in some sense, a measure
  of the signal-to-noise ratio for the class labeling. FLD finds a linear
  combination of features which maximizes the separation after the projection.
  The resulting combination may be used for dimensionality reduction
  before later classification.

  The terms Fisher's linear discriminant and LDA are often used
  interchangeably, although FLD actually describes a slightly different
  discriminant, which does not make some of the assumptions of LDA such
  as normally distributed classes or equal class covariances.
  When the assumptions of LDA are satisfied, FLD is equivalent to LDA.

  FLD is also closely related to principal component analysis (PCA), which also
  looks for linear combinations of variables which best explain the data.
  As a supervised method, FLD explicitly attempts to model the
  difference between the classes of data. On the other hand, PCA is a
  unsupervised method and does not take into account any difference in class.

  One complication in applying FLD (and LDA) to real data

  LDA is closely related to ANOVA (analysis of variance) and linear regression
  analysis, which also attempt to express one dependent variable as a
  linear combination of other features or measurements. In the other two
  methods, however, the dependent variable is a numerical quantity, while
  for LDA it is a categorical variable (i.e. the class label). Logistic
  regression and probit regression are more similar to LDA, as they also
  explain a categorical variable. These other methods are preferable in
  applications where it is not reasonable to assume that the independent
  variables are normally distributed, which is a fundamental assumption
  of the LDA method.

  One complication in applying LDA (and Fisher's discriminant) to real data
  occurs when the number of variables/features does not exceed
  the number of samples. In this case, the covariance estimates do not have
  full rank, and so cannot be inverted. This is known as small sample size
  problem.

  `x` is the training samples.
  `y` is the training labels in `[0, k)`, where `k` is the number of classes.
  `priori` is the priori probability of each class.
  `tol` is the tolerance to decide if a covariance matrix is singular; it
  will reject variables whose variance is less than tol<sup>2</sup>."

(defn qda
  "Quadratic discriminant analysis.

  QDA is closely related to linear discriminant
  analysis (LDA). Like LDA, QDA models the conditional probability density
  functions as a Gaussian distribution, then uses the posterior distributions
  to estimate the class for a given test data. Unlike LDA, however,
  in QDA there is no assumption that the covariance of each of the classes
  is identical. Therefore, the resulting separating surface between
  the classes is quadratic.

  The Gaussian parameters for each class can be estimated from training data
  with maximum likelihood (ML) estimation. However, when the number of
  training instances is small compared to the dimension of input space,
  the ML covariance estimation can be ill-posed. One approach to resolve
  the ill-posed estimation is to regularize the covariance estimation.
  One of these regularization methods is the regularized discriminant
  analysis.

  `x` is the training samples.
  `y` is the training labels in `[0, k)`, where `k` is the number of classes.
  `priori` is the priori probability of each class.
  `tol` is the tolerance to decide if a covariance matrix is singular; it
  will reject variables whose variance is less than tol<sup>2</sup>."

(defn rda
  "Regularized discriminant analysis.

  RDA is a compromise between LDA and QDA, which allows one to shrink
  the separate covariances of QDA toward a common variance as in LDA.
  This method is very similar in flavor to ridge regression.
  The regularized covariance matrices of each class is
  ```
  &Sigma;<sub>k</sub>(&alpha;) = &alpha; &Sigma;<sub>k</sub> + (1 - &alpha;) &Sigma;
  ```
  The quadratic discriminant function is defined using the shrunken covariance
  matrices &Sigma;<sub>k</sub>(&alpha;). The parameter &alpha; in `[0, 1]`
  controls the complexity of the model. When &alpha; is one, RDA becomes QDA.
  While &alpha; is zero, RDA is equivalent to LDA. Therefore, the
  regularization factor &alpha; allows a continuum of models between LDA
  and QDA.
