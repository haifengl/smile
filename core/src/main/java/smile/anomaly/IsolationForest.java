/**
 * Isolation forest is an unsupervised learning algorithm for anomaly
 * detection that works on the principle of isolating anomalies.
 * The algorithm recursively generates partitions on the sample by
 * randomly selecting an attribute and then randomly selecting a split
 * value for the attribute, between the minimum and maximum values
 * allowed for that attribute. The recursive partitioning can be
 * represented by a tree structure named Isolation Tree. The number
 * of partitions required to isolate a point can be interpreted as
 * the length of the path, within the tree, to reach a terminating
 * node starting from the root. When the forest of isolation trees
 * collectively produces shorter path lengths for some samples,
 * they are likely to be anomalies.
 * <p>
 * Rather than selecting a random feature and value within the range
 * of data, Extended isolation forest slices the data using hyperplanes
 * with random slopes. The consistency and reliability of the algorithm
 * is much improved using this extension.
 * <p>
 * For an N dimensional dataset, we can consider N levels of extension.
 * In the fully extended case, we select our normal vector by drawing
 * each component from {@code N (0, 1)} as seen before. This results
 * in hyperplanes that can intersect any of the coordinates axes.
 * However, we can exclude some dimensions in specifying the lines
 * so that they are parallel to the coordinate axes. This is simply
 * accomplished by setting a coordinate of the normal vector to zero.
 * The lowest level of extension of the Extended Isolation Forest
 * is coincident with the standard Isolation Forest. As the extension
 * level of the algorithm is increased, the bias of the algorithm is
 * reduced. The idea of having multiple levels of extension can be useful
 * in cases where the dynamic range of the data in various dimensions are
 * very different. In such cases, reducing the extension level can help in
 * more appropriate selection of split hyperplanes.
