/**
 * Association rule object. Let
 * <code>I = {i<sub>1</sub>, i<sub>2</sub>,..., i<sub>n</sub>}</code>
 * be a set of <code>n</code> binary attributes called items. Let
 * <code>D = {t<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>2</sub>,..., t<sub>m</sub>}</code>
 * be a set of transactions called the database. Each transaction in
 * <code>D</code> has a unique transaction ID and contains a subset
 * of the items in <code>I</code>. An association rule is defined
 * as an implication of the form <code>X &rArr; Y</code>
 * where <code>X, Y &sube; I</code> and <code>X &cap; Y = &Oslash;</code>.
 * The item sets <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> are called
 * antecedent (left-hand-side or LHS) and consequent (right-hand-side or RHS)
 * of the rule, respectively.
 * <p>
 * The support <code>supp(X)</code> of an item
 * set <code>X</code> is defined as the proportion of transactions
 * in the database which contain the item set. Note that the support of
 * an association rule <code>X &rArr; Y</code> is <code>supp(X &cup; Y)</code>.
 * <p>
 * The confidence of a rule is defined as
 * <code>conf(X &rArr; Y) = supp(X &cup; Y) / supp(X)</code>.
 * Confidence can be interpreted as an estimate of the probability
 * <code>P(Y | X)</code>, the probability of finding the RHS of the rule
 * in transactions under the condition that these transactions also contain
 * the LHS.
 * <p>
 * Lift is a measure of the performance of a targeting model
 * (association rule) at predicting or classifying cases as having
 * an enhanced response (with respect to the population as a whole),
 * measured against a random choice targeting model. A targeting model
 * is doing a good job if the response within the target is much better
 * than the average for the population as a whole. Lift is simply the ratio
 * of these values: target response divided by average response.
 * For an association rule <code>X &rArr; Y</code>, if the lift is equal
 * to 1, it means that X and Y are independent. If the lift is higher
 * than 1, it means that X and Y are positively correlated.
 * If the lift is lower than 1, it means that X and Y are negatively
 * correlated.
