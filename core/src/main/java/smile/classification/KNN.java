/**
 * K-nearest neighbor classifier. The k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN) is
 * a method for classifying objects by a majority vote of its neighbors,
 * with the object being assigned to the class most common amongst its k
 * nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small).
 * k-NN is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning where the
 * function is only approximated locally and all computation
 * is deferred until classification.
 * <p>
 * The best choice of k depends upon the data; generally, larger values of
 * k reduce the effect of noise on the classification, but make boundaries
 * between classes less distinct. A good k can be selected by various
 * heuristic techniques, e.g. cross-validation. In binary problems, it is
 * helpful to choose k to be an odd number as this avoids tied votes.
 * <p>
 * A drawback to the basic majority voting classification is that the classes
 * with the more frequent instances tend to dominate the prediction of the
 * new object, as they tend to come up in the k nearest neighbors when
 * the neighbors are computed due to their large number. One way to overcome
 * this problem is to weight the classification taking into account the
 * distance from the test point to each of its k nearest neighbors.
 * <p>
 * Often, the classification accuracy of k-NN can be improved significantly
 * if the distance metric is learned with specialized algorithms such as
 * Large Margin Nearest Neighbor or Neighborhood Components Analysis.
 * <p>
 * Nearest neighbor rules in effect compute the decision boundary in an
 * implicit manner. It is also possible to compute the decision boundary
 * itself explicitly, and to do so in an efficient manner so that the
 * computational complexity is a function of the boundary complexity.
 * <p>
 * The nearest neighbor algorithm has some strong consistency results. As
 * the amount of data approaches infinity, the algorithm is guaranteed to
 * yield an error rate no worse than twice the Bayes error rate (the minimum 
 * achievable error rate given the distribution of the data). k-NN is
 * guaranteed to approach the Bayes error rate, for some value of k (where k
 * increases as a function of the number of data points).
 *
 * @param <T> the data type of model input objects.
