/**
 * Clustering Large Applications based upon RANdomized Search. CLARANS is an
 * efficient medoid-based clustering algorithm. The k-medoids algorithm is an
 * adaptation of the k-means algorithm. Rather than calculate the mean of the
 * items in each cluster, a representative item, or medoid, is chosen for each
 * cluster at each iteration. In CLARANS, the process of finding k medoids from
 * n objects is viewed abstractly as searching through a certain graph. In the
 * graph, a node is represented by a set of k objects as selected medoids. Two
 * nodes are neighbors if their sets differ by only one object. In each iteration,
 * CLARANS considers a set of randomly chosen neighbor nodes as candidate
 * of new medoids. We will move to the neighbor node if the neighbor
 * is a better choice for medoids. Otherwise, a local optima is discovered. The
 * entire process is repeated multiple time to find better.
 * <p>
 * CLARANS has two parameters: the maximum number of neighbors examined
 * (maxNeighbor) and the number of local minima obtained (numLocal). The
 * higher the value of maxNeighbor, the closer is CLARANS to PAM, and the
 * longer is each search of a local minima. But the quality of such a local
 * minima is higher and fewer local minima needs to be obtained.
