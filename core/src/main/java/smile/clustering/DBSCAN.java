/**
 * Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise.
 * DBSCAN finds a number of clusters starting from the estimated density
 * distribution of corresponding nodes.
 * <p>
 * DBSCAN requires two parameters: radius (i.e. neighborhood radius) and the
 * number of minimum points required to form a cluster (minPts). It starts
 * with an arbitrary starting point that has not been visited. This point's
 * neighborhood is retrieved, and if it contains sufficient number of points,
 * a cluster is started. Otherwise, the point is labeled as noise. Note that
 * this point might later be found in a sufficiently sized radius-environment
 * of a different point and hence be made part of a cluster.
 * <p>
 * If a point is found to be part of a cluster, its neighborhood is also
 * part of that cluster. Hence, all points that are found within the
 * neighborhood are added, as is their own neighborhood. This process
 * continues until the cluster is completely found. Then, a new unvisited point
 * is retrieved and processed, leading to the discovery of a further cluster
 * of noise.
 * <p>
 * DBSCAN visits each point of the database, possibly multiple times (e.g.,
 * as candidates to different clusters). For practical considerations, however,
 * the time complexity is mostly governed by the number of nearest neighbor
 * queries. DBSCAN executes exactly one such query for each point, and if
 * an indexing structure is used that executes such a neighborhood query
 * in O(log n), an overall runtime complexity of O(n log n) is obtained.
 * <p>
 * DBSCAN has many advantages such as
 * <ul>
 * <li> DBSCAN does not need to know the number of clusters in the data
 *      a priori, as opposed to k-means.
 * <li> DBSCAN can find arbitrarily shaped clusters. It can even find clusters
 *      completely surrounded by (but not connected to) a different cluster.
 *      Due to the MinPts parameter, the so-called single-link effect
 *     (different clusters being connected by a thin line of points) is reduced.
 * <li> DBSCAN has a notion of noise. Outliers are labeled as Clustering.OUTLIER,
 *      which is Integer.MAX_VALUE.
 * <li> DBSCAN requires just two parameters and is mostly insensitive to the
 *      ordering of the points in the database. (Only points sitting on the
 *      edge of two different clusters might swap cluster membership if the
 *      ordering of the points is changed, and the cluster assignment is unique
 *      only up to isomorphism.)
 * </ul>
 * On the other hand, DBSCAN has the disadvantages of
 * <ul>
 * <li> In high dimensional space, the data are sparse everywhere
 *      because of the curse of dimensionality. Therefore, DBSCAN doesn't
 *      work well on high-dimensional data in general.
 * <li> DBSCAN does not respond well to data sets with varying densities.
 * </ul>
