/**
 * Fast pair algorithm: hybrid of conga line and nearest neighbors.
 * <p>
 * This is based on the observation that the conga line data structure,
 * in practice, does better the more subsets you give to it: even though the
 * worst case time for k subsets is O(nk log (n/k)), that worst case
 * seems much harder to reach than the nearest neighbor algorithm.
 * In the limit of arbitrarily many subsets, each new addition or point moved
 * by a deletion will be in a singleton subset, and the algorithm will
 * differ from nearest neighbors in only a couple of ways: (1) when we
 * create the initial data structure, we use a conga line rather than
 * all nearest neighbors, to keep the in-degree of each point low, and
 * (2) when we insert a point, we don't bother updating other points' neighbors.
 * <p>
 * Total space: 20n bytes. (Could be reduced to 4n at some cost in update time.)
 * Time per insertion or single distance update: O(n)
 * Time per deletion or point update: O(n) expected, O(n<sup>2</sup>) worst case
 * Time per closest pair: O(n)
