/**
 * Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering
 * seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters in a bottom up approach: each
 * observation starts in its own cluster, and pairs of clusters are merged as
 * one moves up the hierarchy. The results of hierarchical clustering are
 * usually presented in a dendrogram.
 * <p>
 * In general, the merges are determined in a greedy manner. In order to decide
 * which clusters should be combined, a measure of dissimilarity between sets
 * of observations is required. In most methods of hierarchical clustering,
 * this is achieved by use of an appropriate metric, and a linkage criteria
 * which specifies the dissimilarity of sets as a function of the pairwise
 * distances of observations in the sets.
 * <p>
 * Hierarchical clustering has the distinct advantage that any valid measure
 * of distance can be used. In fact, the observations themselves are not
 * required: all that is used is a matrix of distances.
