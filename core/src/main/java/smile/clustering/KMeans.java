/**
 * K-Means clustering. The algorithm partitions n observations into k clusters
 * in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.
 * Although finding an exact solution to the k-means problem for arbitrary
 * input is NP-hard, the standard approach to finding an approximate solution
 * (often called Lloyd's algorithm or the k-means algorithm) is used widely
 * and frequently finds reasonable solutions quickly.
 * <p>
 * K-means has a number of interesting theoretical properties. First, it
 * partitions the data space into a structure known as a Voronoi diagram.
 * Second, it is conceptually close to nearest neighbor classification,
 * and as such is popular in machine learning. Third, it can be seen as
 * a variation of model based clustering, and Lloyd's algorithm as a
 * variation of the EM algorithm.
 * <p>
 * However, the k-means algorithm has at least two major theoretic shortcomings:
 * <ul>
 * <li> First, it has been shown that the worst case running time of the
 * algorithm is super-polynomial in the input size.
 * <li> Second, the approximation found can be arbitrarily bad with respect
 * to the objective function compared to the optimal learn. Therefore,
 * it is common to run multiple times with different random initializations.
 * </ul>
 *
 * In this implementation, we use k-means++ which addresses the second of these
 * obstacles by specifying a procedure to initialize the cluster centers before
 * proceeding with the standard k-means optimization iterations. With the
 * k-means++ initialization, the algorithm is guaranteed to find a solution
 * that is O(log k) competitive to the optimal k-means solution.
 * <p>
 * We also use k-d trees to speed up each k-means step as described in the filter
 * algorithm by Kanungo, et al.
 * <p>
 * K-means is a hard clustering method, i.e. each observation is assigned to
 * a specific cluster. In contrast, soft clustering, e.g. the
 * Expectation-Maximization algorithm for Gaussian mixtures, assign observations
 * to different clusters with different probabilities.
