     * Initialize cluster membership of input objects with K-Means++ algorithm.
     * Many clustering methods, e.g. k-means, need an initial clustering
     * configuration as a seed.
     * <p>
     * K-Means++ is based on the intuition of spreading the k initial cluster
     * centers away from each other. The first cluster center is chosen uniformly
     * at random from the data points that are being clustered, after which each
     * subsequent cluster center is chosen from the remaining data points with
     * probability proportional to its distance squared to the point's closest
     * cluster center.
     * <p>
     * The exact algorithm is as follows:
     * <ol>
     * <li> Choose one center uniformly at random from among the data points. </li>
     * <li> For each data point x, compute D(x), the distance between x and the nearest center that has already been chosen. </li>
     * <li> Choose one new data point at random as a new center, using a weighted probability distribution where a point x is chosen with probability proportional to D<sup>2</sup>(x). </li>
     * <li> Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until k centers have been chosen. </li>
     * <li> Now that the initial centers have been chosen, proceed using standard k-means clustering. </li>
     * </ol>
     * This seeding method gives out considerable improvements in the final error
     * of k-means. Although the initial selection in the algorithm takes extra time,
     * the k-means part itself converges very fast after this seeding and thus
     * the algorithm actually lowers the computation time too.
