/**
 * Feature extraction. Feature extraction transforms the data in the
 * high-dimensional space to a space of fewer dimensions. The data
 * transformation may be linear, as in principal component analysis (PCA),
 * but many nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques also exist.
 * <p>
 * The main linear technique for dimensionality reduction, principal component
 * analysis, performs a linear mapping of the data to a lower dimensional
 * space in such a way that the variance of the data in the low-dimensional
 * representation is maximized. In practice, the correlation matrix of the
 * data is constructed and the eigenvectors on this matrix are computed.
 * The eigenvectors that correspond to the largest eigenvalues (the principal
 * components) can now be used to reconstruct a large fraction of the variance
 * of the original data. Moreover, the first few eigenvectors can often be
 * interpreted in terms of the large-scale physical behavior of the system.
 * The original space has been reduced (with data loss, but hopefully
 * retaining the most important variance) to the space spanned by a few
 * eigenvectors.
 * <p>
 * Compared to regular batch PCA algorithm, the generalized Hebbian algorithm
 * is an adaptive method to find the largest k eigenvectors of the covariance
 * matrix, assuming that the associated eigenvalues are distinct. GHA works
 * with an arbitrarily large sample size and the storage requirement is modest.
 * Another attractive feature is that, in a non-stationary environment, it
 * has an inherent ability to track gradual changes in the optimal solution
 * in an inexpensive way.
 * <p>
 * Random projection is a promising linear dimensionality reduction technique
 * for learning mixtures of Gaussians. The key idea of random projection arises
 * from the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma: if points in a vector space are
 * projected onto a randomly selected subspace of suitably high dimension,
 * then the distances between the points are approximately preserved.
 * <p>
 * Principal component analysis can be employed in a nonlinear way by means
 * of the kernel trick. The resulting technique is capable of constructing
 * nonlinear mappings that maximize the variance in the data. The resulting
 * technique is entitled Kernel PCA. Other prominent nonlinear techniques
 * include manifold learning techniques such as locally linear embedding
 * (LLE), Hessian LLE, Laplacian eigenmaps, and LTSA. These techniques
 * construct a low-dimensional data representation using a cost function
 * that retains local properties of the data, and can be viewed as defining
 * a graph-based kernel for Kernel PCA. More recently, techniques have been
 * proposed that, instead of defining a fixed kernel, try to learn the kernel
 * using semidefinite programming. The most prominent example of such a
 * technique is maximum variance unfolding (MVU). The central idea of MVU
 * is to exactly preserve all pairwise distances between nearest neighbors
 * (in the inner product space), while maximizing the distances between points
 * that are not nearest neighbors.
 * <p>
 * An alternative approach to neighborhood preservation is through the
 * minimization of a cost function that measures differences between
 * distances in the input and output spaces. Important examples of such
 * techniques include classical multidimensional scaling (which is identical
 * to PCA), Isomap (which uses geodesic distances in the data space), diffusion
 * maps (which uses diffusion distances in the data space), t-SNE (which
 * minimizes the divergence between distributions over pairs of points),
 * and curvilinear component analysis.
 * <p>
 * A different approach to nonlinear dimensionality reduction is through the
 * use of autoencoders, a special kind of feed-forward neural networks with
 * a bottleneck hidden layer. The training of deep encoders is typically
 * performed using a greedy layer-wise pre-training (e.g., using a stack of
 * Restricted Boltzmann machines) that is followed by a fine-tuning stage based
 * on backpropagation.
