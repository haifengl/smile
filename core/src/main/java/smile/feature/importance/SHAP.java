/**
 * SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a game theoretic approach to
 * explain the output of any machine learning model. It connects optimal
 * credit allocation with local explanations using the classic Shapley
 * values from game theory.
 * <p>
 * SHAP leverages local methods designed to explain a prediction
 * <code>f(x)</code> based on a single input <code>x</code>.
 * The local methods are defined as any interpretable approximation
 * of the original model. In particular, SHAP employs additive feature
 * attribution methods.
 * <p>
 * SHAP values attribute to each feature the change in the expected
 * model prediction when conditioning on that feature. They explain
 * how to get from the base value <code>E[f(z)]</code> that would be
 * predicted if we did not know any features to the current output
 * <code>f(x)</code>.
 * <p>
 * In game theory, the Shapley value is the average expected marginal
 * contribution of one player after all possible combinations have
 * been considered.
