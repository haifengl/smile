/**
 * Missing value imputation with singular value decomposition. Given SVD
 * A = U &Sigma; V<sup>T</sup>, we use the most significant eigenvectors of
 * V<sup>T</sup> to linearly estimate missing values. Although it has been
 * shown that several significant eigenvectors are sufficient to describe
 * the data with small errors, the exact fraction of eigenvectors best for
 * estimation needs to be determined empirically. Once k most significant
 * eigenvectors from V<sup>T</sup> are selected, we estimate a missing value j
 * in row i by first regressing this row against the k eigenvectors and then use
 * the coefficients of the regression to reconstruct j from a linear combination
 * of the k eigenvectors. The j th value of row i and the j th values of the k
 * eigenvectors are not used in determining these regression coefficients.
 * It should be noted that SVD can only be performed on complete matrices;
 * therefore we originally fill all missing values by other methods in
 * matrix A, obtaining A'. We then utilize an expectation maximization method to
 * arrive at the final estimate, as follows. Each missing value in A is estimated
 * using the above algorithm, and then the procedure is repeated on the newly
 * obtained matrix, until the total change in the matrix falls below the
 * empirically determined threshold (say 0.01).
