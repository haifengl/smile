/**
 * The standard bit string representation of the solution domain.
 * Here are some general guides on parameter setting.
 * <p>
 * Crossover rate determines how often will be crossover performed. If
 * there is no crossover, offspring is exact copy of parents. If there is a
 * crossover, offspring is made from parts of parents' chromosome. If crossover
 * rate is 100%, then all offspring is made by crossover. If it is 0%, whole
 * new generation is made from exact copies of chromosomes from old population.
 * However, it this does not mean that the new generation is the same because
 * of mutation. Crossover is made in hope that new chromosomes will have good
 * parts of old chromosomes and maybe the new chromosomes will be better.
 * However it is good to leave some part of population survive to next
 * generation. Crossover rate generally should be high, about 80% - 95%.
 * However some results show that for some problems crossover rate about 60% is
 * the best.
 * <p>
 * Mutation rate determines how often will be parts of chromosome mutated.
 * If there is no mutation, offspring is taken after crossover (or copy) without
 * any change. If mutation is performed, part of chromosome is changed.
 * Mutation is made to prevent falling GA into local extreme, but it should not
 * occur very often, because then GA will in fact change to random search.
 * Best rates reported are about 0.5% - 1%.
