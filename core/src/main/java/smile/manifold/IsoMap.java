/**
 * Isometric feature mapping. Isomap is a widely used low-dimensional embedding methods,
 * where geodesic distances on a weighted graph are incorporated with the
 * classical multidimensional scaling. Isomap is used for computing a
 * quasi-isometric, low-dimensional embedding of a set of high-dimensional
 * data points. Isomap is highly efficient and generally applicable to a broad
 * range of data sources and dimensionalities.
 * <p>
 * To be specific, the classical MDS performs low-dimensional embedding based
 * on the pairwise distance between data points, which is generally measured
 * using straight-line Euclidean distance. Isomap is distinguished by
 * its use of the geodesic distance induced by a neighborhood graph
 * embedded in the classical scaling. This is done to incorporate manifold
 * structure in the resulting embedding. Isomap defines the geodesic distance
 * to be the sum of edge weights along the shortest path between two nodes.
 * The top n eigenvectors of the geodesic distance matrix, represent the
 * coordinates in the new n-dimensional Euclidean space.
 * <p>
 * The connectivity of each data point in the neighborhood graph is defined
 * as its nearest k Euclidean neighbors in the high-dimensional space. This
 * step is vulnerable to "short-circuit errors" if k is too large with
 * respect to the manifold structure or if noise in the data moves the
 * points slightly off the manifold. Even a single short-circuit error
 * can alter many entries in the geodesic distance matrix, which in turn
 * can lead to a drastically different (and incorrect) low-dimensional
 * embedding. Conversely, if k is too small, the neighborhood graph may
 * become too sparse to approximate geodesic paths accurately.
 * <p>
 * This class implements C-Isomap that involves magnifying the regions
 * of high density and shrink the regions of low density of data points
 * in the manifold. Edge weights that are maximized in Multi-Dimensional
 * Scaling(MDS) are modified, with everything else remaining unaffected.
