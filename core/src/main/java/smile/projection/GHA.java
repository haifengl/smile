/**
 * Generalized Hebbian Algorithm. GHA is a linear feed-forward neural
 * network model for unsupervised learning with applications primarily in
 * principal components analysis. It is single-layer process -- that is, a
 * synaptic weight changes only depending on the response of the inputs and
 * outputs of that layer.
 * <p>
 * It guarantees that GHA finds the first k eigenvectors of the covariance matrix,
 * assuming that the associated eigenvalues are distinct. The convergence theorem
 * is formulated in terms of a time-varying learning rate &eta;. In practice, the
 * learning rate &eta; is chosen to be a small constant, in which case convergence is
 * guaranteed with mean-squared error in synaptic weights of order &eta;.
 * <p>
 * It also has a simple and predictable trade-off between learning speed and
 * accuracy of convergence as set by the learning rate parameter &eta;. It was
 * shown that a larger learning rate &eta; leads to faster convergence
 * and larger asymptotic mean-square error, which is intuitively satisfying.
 * <p>
 * Compared to regular batch PCA algorithm based on eigen decomposition, GHA is
 * an adaptive method and works with an arbitrarily large sample size. The storage
 * requirement is modest. Another attractive feature is that, in a nonstationary
 * environment, it has an inherent ability to track gradual changes in the
 * optimal solution in an inexpensive way.
