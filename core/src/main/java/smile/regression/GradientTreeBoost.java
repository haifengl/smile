/**
 * Gradient boosting for regression. Gradient boosting is typically used
 * with decision trees (especially CART regression trees) of a fixed size as
 * base learners. For this special case Friedman proposes a modification to
 * gradient boosting method which improves the quality of fit of each base
 * learner.
 * <p>
 * Generic gradient boosting at the t-th step would fit a regression tree to
 * pseudo-residuals. Let J be the number of its leaves. The tree partitions
 * the input space into J disjoint regions and predicts a constant value in
 * each region. The parameter J controls the maximum allowed
 * level of interaction between variables in the model. With J = 2 (decision
 * stumps), no interaction between variables is allowed. With J = 3 the model
 * may include effects of the interaction between up to two variables, and
 * so on. Hastie et al. comment that typically 4 &le; J &le; 8 work well
 * for boosting and results are fairly insensitive to the choice of in
 * this range, J = 2 is insufficient for many applications, and J &gt; 10 is
 * unlikely to be required.
 * <p>
 * Fitting the training set too closely can lead to degradation of the model's
 * generalization ability. Several so-called regularization techniques reduce
 * this over-fitting effect by constraining the fitting procedure.
 * One natural regularization parameter is the number of gradient boosting
 * iterations T (i.e. the number of trees in the model when the base learner
 * is a decision tree). Increasing T reduces the error on training set,
 * but setting it too high may lead to over-fitting. An optimal value of T
 * is often selected by monitoring prediction error on a separate validation
 * data set.
 * <p>
 * Another regularization approach is the shrinkage which times a parameter
 * &eta; (called the "learning rate") to update term.
 * Empirically it has been found that using small learning rates (such as
 * &eta; &lt; 0.1) yields dramatic improvements in model's generalization ability
 * over gradient boosting without shrinking (&eta; = 1). However, it comes at
 * the price of increasing computational time both during training and
 * prediction: lower learning rate requires more iterations.
 * <p>
 * Soon after the introduction of gradient boosting Friedman proposed a
 * minor modification to the algorithm, motivated by Breiman's bagging method.
 * Specifically, he proposed that at each iteration of the algorithm, a base
 * learner should be fit on a subsample of the training set drawn at random
 * without replacement. Friedman observed a substantional improvement in
 * gradient boosting's accuracy with this modification.
 * <p>
 * Subsample size is some constant fraction f of the size of the training set.
 * When f = 1, the algorithm is deterministic and identical to the one
 * described above. Smaller values of f introduce randomness into the
 * algorithm and help prevent over-fitting, acting as a kind of regularization.
 * The algorithm also becomes faster, because regression trees have to be fit
 * to smaller datasets at each iteration. Typically, f is set to 0.5, meaning
 * that one half of the training set is used to build each base learner.
 * <p>
 * Also, like in bagging, sub-sampling allows one to define an out-of-bag
 * estimate of the prediction performance improvement by evaluating predictions
 * on those observations which were not used in the building of the next
 * base learner. Out-of-bag estimates help avoid the need for an independent
 * validation dataset, but often underestimate actual performance improvement
 * and the optimal number of iterations.
 * <p>
 * Gradient tree boosting implementations often also use regularization by
 * limiting the minimum number of observations in trees' terminal nodes.
 * It's used in the tree building process by ignoring any splits that lead
 * to nodes containing fewer than this number of training set instances.
 * Imposing this limit helps to reduce variance in predictions at leaves.
