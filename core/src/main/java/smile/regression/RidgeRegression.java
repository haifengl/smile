/**
 * Ridge Regression. Coefficient estimates for multiple linear regression
 * models rely on the independence of the model terms. When terms are
 * correlated and the columns of the design matrix X have an approximate
 * linear dependence, the matrix <code>X'X</code> becomes close to singular.
 * As a result, the least-squares estimate becomes highly sensitive to random
 * errors in the observed response <code>Y</code>, producing a large variance.
 * <p>
 * Ridge regression is one method to address these issues. In ridge regression,
 * the matrix <code>X'X</code> is perturbed so as to make its determinant
 * appreciably different from 0.
 * <p>
 * Ridge regression is a kind of Tikhonov regularization, which is the most
 * commonly used method of regularization of ill-posed problems.
 * Ridge regression shrinks the regression coefficients by imposing a penalty
 * on their size. By allowing a small amount of bias in the estimates, more
 * reasonable coefficients may often be obtained. Often, small amounts of bias
 * lead to dramatic reductions in the variance of the estimated model
 * coefficients.
 * <p>
 * Another interpretation of ridge regression is available through Bayesian
 * estimation. In this setting the belief that weight should be small is
 * coded into a prior distribution.
 * <p>
 * The penalty term is unfair if the predictor variables are not on the
 * same scale. Therefore, if we know that the variables are not measured
 * in the same units, we typically scale the columns of X (to have sample
 * variance 1), and then we perform ridge regression.
 * <p>
 * When including an intercept term in the regression, we usually leave
 * this coefficient unpenalized. Otherwise we could add some constant
 * amount to the vector <code>y</code>, and this would not result in
 * the same solution. If we center the columns of <code>X</code>, then
 * the intercept estimate ends up just being the mean of <code>y</code>.
 * <p>
 * Ridge regression does not set coefficients exactly to zero unless
 * <code>&lambda; = &infin;</code>, in which case they're all zero.
 * Hence ridge regression cannot perform variable selection, and
 * even though it performs well in terms of prediction accuracy,
 * it does poorly in terms of offering a clear interpretation.
