/**
 * Sensitivity or true positive rate (TPR) (also called hit rate, recall) is a
 * statistical measures of the performance of a binary classification test.
 * Sensitivity is the proportion of actual positives which are correctly
 * identified as such.
 * <p>
 * TPR = TP / P = TP / (TP + FN)
 * <p>
 * Sensitivity and specificity are closely related to the concepts of type
 * I and type II errors. For any test, there is usually a trade-off between
 * the measures. This trade-off can be represented graphically using an ROC curve.
 * <p>
 * In this implementation, the class label 1 is regarded as positive and 0
 * is regarded as negative.
