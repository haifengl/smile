/**
 * Log loss is an evaluation metric for binary classifiers, and it is sometimes
 * the optimization objective as well in case of logistic regression and neural
 * networks. Log Loss takes into account the uncertainty of the prediction
 * based on how much it varies from the actual label. This provides a more
 * nuanced view of the performance of the model. In general, minimizing
 * Log Loss gives greater accuracy for the classifier. However, it is
 * susceptible in case of imbalanced data.
