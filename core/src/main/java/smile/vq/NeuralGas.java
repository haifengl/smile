/**
 * Neural Gas soft competitive learning algorithm. Neural Gas is inspired
 * by the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) for finding optimal data representations
 * based on feature vectors. The algorithm was coined "Neural Gas" because of
 * the dynamics of the feature vectors during the adaptation process, which
 * distribute themselves like a gas within the data space. Although it is
 * mainly applied where data compression or vector quantization is an issue,
 * it is also used for cluster analysis as a robustly converging alternative
 * to k-means. A prominent extension is the Growing Neural Gas.
 * <p>
 * Compared to SOM, Neural Gas has no topology of a fixed dimensionality
 * (in fact, no topology at all). For each input signal during learning,
 * Neural Gas sorts the neurons of the network according to the distance
 * of their reference vectors to the input signal. Based on this "rank order",
 * neurons are adapted based on the adaptation strength that are decreased
 * according to a fixed schedule.
 * <p>
 * The adaptation step of the Neural Gas can be interpreted as gradient
 * descent on a cost function. By adapting not only the closest feature
 * vector but all of them with a step size decreasing with increasing
 * distance order, compared to k-means, a much more robust convergence
 * of the algorithm can be achieved.
