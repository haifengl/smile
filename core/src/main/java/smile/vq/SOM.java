/**
 * Self-Organizing Map. An SOM is an unsupervised learning method to produce
 * a low-dimensional (typically two-dimensional) discretized representation
 * (called a map) of the input space of the training samples. The model was
 * first described as an artificial neural network by Teuvo Kohonen, and is
 * sometimes called a Kohonen map.
 * <p>
 * While it is typical to consider SOMs as related to feed-forward networks where
 * the nodes are visualized as being attached, this type of architecture is
 * fundamentally different in arrangement and motivation because SOMs use a
 * neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of the input
 * space. This makes SOMs useful for visualizing low-dimensional views of
 * high-dimensional data, akin to multidimensional scaling.
 * <p>
 * SOMs belong to a large family of competitive learning process and vector
 * quantization. An SOM consists of components called nodes or neurons.
 * Associated with each node is a weight vector of the same dimension as
 * the input data vectors and a position in the map space. The usual arrangement
 * of nodes is a regular spacing in a hexagonal or rectangular grid. The
 * self-organizing map describes a mapping from a higher dimensional input
 * space to a lower dimensional map space. During the (iterative) learning,
 * the input vectors are compared to the weight vector of each neuron. Neurons
 * who most closely match the input are known as the best match unit (BMU) of
 * the system. The weight vector of the BMU and those of nearby neurons are
 * adjusted to be closer to the input vector by a certain step size.
 * <p>
 * There are two ways to interpret a SOM. Because in the training phase weights
 * of the whole neighborhood are moved in the same direction, similar items
 * tend to excite adjacent neurons. Therefore, SOM forms a semantic map where
 * similar samples are mapped close together and dissimilar apart.
 * The other way is to think of neuronal weights as pointers to the input space.
 * They form a discrete approximation of the distribution of training samples.
 * More neurons point to regions with high training sample concentration and
 * fewer where the samples are scarce.
 * <p>
 * SOM may be considered a nonlinear generalization of Principal components
 * analysis (PCA). It has been shown, using both artificial and real
 * geophysical data, that SOM has many advantages over the conventional feature
 * extraction methods such as Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) or PCA.
 * <p>
 * It has been shown that while SOMs with a small number of nodes behave in a
 * way that is similar to K-means. However, larger SOMs rearrange data
 * in a way that is fundamentally topological in character and display properties
 * which are emergent. Therefore, large maps are preferable to smaller ones.
 * In maps consisting of thousands of nodes, it is possible to perform cluster
 * operations on the map itself.
 * <p>
 * A common way to display SOMs is the heat map of U-matrix. The U-matrix value
 * of a particular node is the minimum/maximum/average distance between the node
 * and its closest neighbors. In a rectangular grid for instance, we might
 * consider the closest 4 or 8 nodes.
