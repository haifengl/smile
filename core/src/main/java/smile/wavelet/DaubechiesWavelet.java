/**
 * Daubechies wavelets. The Daubechies wavelets are a family of orthogonal
 * wavelets defining a discrete wavelet transform and characterized by a
 * maximal number of vanishing moments for some given support.
 * <p>
 * In general the Daubechies wavelets are chosen to have the highest number A
 * of vanishing moments, (this does not imply the best smoothness) for give
 * n support width N = 2A, and among the 2A?1 possible solutions the one is
 * chosen whose scaling filter has extremal phase. The wavelet transform is
 * also easy to put into practice using the fast wavelet transform. Daubechies
 * wavelets are widely used in solving a broad range of problems,
 * e.g. self-similarity properties of a signal or fractal problems, signal
 * discontinuities, etc.
 * <p>
 * The Daubechies wavelets are not defined in terms of the resulting scaling
 * and wavelet functions; in fact, they are not possible to write down in
 * closed form.
 * <p>
 * Daubechies orthogonal wavelets D2-D20 (even index numbers only) are commonly
 * used. The index number refers to the number N of coefficients. Each wavelet
 * has a number of zero moments or vanishing moments equal to half the number
 * of coefficients. For example, D2 (the Haar wavelet) has one vanishing
 * moment, D4 has two, etc. A vanishing moment limits the wavelet's ability
 * to represent polynomial behaviour or information in a signal. For example,
 * D2, with one moment, easily encodes polynomials of one coefficient, or
 * constant signal components. D4 encodes polynomials with two coefficients,
 * i.e. constant and linear signal components; and D6 encodes 3-polynomials,
 * i.e. constant, linear and quadratic signal components. This ability to
 * encode signals is nonetheless subject to the phenomenon of scale leakage,
 * and the lack of shift-invariance, which arise from the discrete shifting
 * operation during application of the transform. Sub-sequences which represent
 * linear, quadratic (for example) signal components are treated differently
 * by the transform depending on whether the points align with even- or
 * odd-numbered locations in the sequence. The lack of the important property
 * of shift-invariance, has led to the development of several different versions
 * of a shift-invariant (discrete) wavelet transform.
