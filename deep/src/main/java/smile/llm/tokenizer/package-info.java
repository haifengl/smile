/**
 * LLM Tokenization. Tokens are the fundamental unit, the "atom" of LLMs.
 * Tokenization is the process of translating text and converting them
 * into sequences of tokens and vice versa. A token is not necessarily
 * a word. It could be a smaller unit, like a part of a word, or a larger
 * one like a character or a whole phrase. The size of the tokens vary from
 * one tokenization approach to another.
 * <p>
 * Byte pair encoding (BPE, also known as digram coding) is a widely used
 * LLM tokenizer with an ability to combine both tokens that encode single
 * characters (including single digits or single punctuation marks) and those
 * that encode whole words (even the longest compound words). The algorithm,
 * in the first step, assumes all unique characters to be an initial set of
 * 1-character long n-grams (i.e. initial "tokens"). Then, successively the
 * most frequent pair of adjacent characters is merged into a new, 2-character
 * long n-gram and all instances of the pair are replaced by this new token.
 * This is repeated until a vocabulary of prescribed size is obtained.
 * Note that new words can always be constructed from final vocabulary tokens
 * and initial-set characters.
