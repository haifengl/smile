 * Bicubic spline interpolation in a two-dimensional regular grid. Bicubic
 * spline interpolation guarantees the continuity of the first derivatives,
 * as well as the continuity of a cross-derivative.
 * <p>
 * It is similar to one-dimensional splines, but there are some differences.
 * The cubic spline guarantees the continuity of the first and second function
 * derivatives. Bicubic spline guarantees continuity of only gradient and
 * cross-derivative. Second derivatives could be discontinuous.
