/**
 * Kriging interpolation for the data points irregularly distributed in space.
 * Kriging belongs to the family of linear least squares estimation algorithms,
 * also known as Gauss-Markov estimation or Gaussian process regression.
 * <p>
 * Kriging can be either an interpolation method or a fitting method. The distinction
 * between the two is whether the fitted/interpolated function goes exactly
 * through all the input data points (interpolation), or whether it allows
 * measurement errors to be specified and then "smooths" to get a statistically
 * better predictor that does not generally go through the data points.
 * <p>
 * The aim of kriging is to estimate the value of an unknown real-valued
 * function, f, at a point, x, given the values of the function at some
 * other points, x<sub>1</sub>,&hellip;, x<sub>n</sub>. Kriging computes the
 * best linear unbiased estimator based on a stochastic model of the spatial
 * dependence quantified either by the variogram &gamma;(x,y) or by expectation
 * &mu;(x) = E[f(x)] and the covariance function c(x,y) of the random field.
 * A kriging estimator is a linear combination that may be written as
 * <p>
 * &fnof;(x) = &Sigma; &lambda;<sub>i</sub>(x) f(x<sub>i</sub>)
 * <p>
 * The weights &lambda;<sub>i</sub> are solutions of a system of linear
 * equations which is obtained by assuming that f is a sample-path of a
 * random process F(x), and that the error of prediction
 * <p>
 * &epsilon;(x) = F(x) - &Sigma; &lambda;<sub>i</sub>(x) F(x<sub>i</sub>)
 * <p>
 * is to be minimized in some sense.
 * <p>
 * Depending on the stochastic properties of the random field different
 * types of kriging apply. The type of kriging determines the linear
 * constraint on the weights &lambda;<sub>i</sub> implied by the unbiasedness
 * condition; i.e. the linear constraint, and hence the method for calculating
 * the weights, depends upon the type of kriging.
 * <p>
 * This class implements ordinary kriging, which is the most commonly used type
 * of kriging. The typical assumptions for the practical application of ordinary
 * kriging are:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Intrinsic stationarity or wide sense stationarity of the field
 * <li> enough observations to estimate the variogram.
 * </ul>
 * The mathematical condition for applicability of ordinary kriging are:
 * <ul>
 * <li> The mean E[f(x)] = &mu; is unknown but constant
 * <li> The variogram &gamma;(x,y) = E[(f(x) - f(y))<sup>2</sup>] of f(x) is known.
 * </ul>
 * The kriging weights of ordinary kriging fulfill the unbiasedness condition
 * &Sigma; &lambda;<sub>i</sub> = 1
