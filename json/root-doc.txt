JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format.
It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse
and generate. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent
but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of
languages,

JSON has only types of string, number, boolean, object, array, and null.
This library includes additional types such as date, int, long, double,
counter, binary, UUID, ObjectId (as in BSON), etc.

It is very easy to parse a JSON object:
{{{
val doc =
  json"""
  {
    "store": {
      "book": [
        {
          "category": "reference",
          "author": "Nigel Rees",
          "title": "Sayings of the Century",
          "price": 8.95
        },
        {
          "category": "fiction",
          "author": "Evelyn Waugh",
          "title": "Sword of Honour",
          "price": 12.99
        },
        {
          "category": "fiction",
          "author": "Herman Melville",
          "title": "Moby Dick",
          "isbn": "0-553-21311-3",
          "price": 8.99
        },
        {
          "category": "fiction",
          "author": "J. R. R. Tolkien",
          "title": "The Lord of the Rings",
          "isbn": "0-395-19395-8",
          "price": 22.99
        }
      ],
      "bicycle": {
        "color": "red",
        "price": 19.95
      }
    }
  }
  """
}}}
The interpolator `json` parse a string to `JsObject`. It is also okay to embed
variable references directly in processed string literals.

{{{
val x = 1
json"""
  {
    "x": $x
  }
"""
}}}
If the string is not a JSON object but any other valid JSON expression,
one may use parseJson method to convert the string to a `JsValue`.
{{{
"1".parseJson
}}}
The json interpolator can only be applied to string literals.
If you want to parse a string variable, the `parseJson` method can
always be employed. If you know the string contains a JSON object,
you may also use the method `parseJsObject`.

{{{
val s = """{"x":1}"""
s.parseJsObject
}}}
To serialize a JSON value (of type JsValue) in compact mode, you can
just use `toString`. To pretty print, use the method `prettyPrint`.

{{{
doc.toString
doc.prettyPrint
}}}
With a `JsObject` or `JsArray`, you can refer to the individual
elements with a variation of array syntax, like this:
{{{
doc("store")("bicycle")("color")
// Use symbol instead of string
doc('store)('bicycle)('color)
}}}
Note that we follow Scala's array access convention by `()` rather than
`[]` in JavaScript.

Besides, you can use the dot notation to access its fields/elements
just like in JavaScript:
{{{
doc.store.bicycle.color
doc.store.book(0).author
}}}
It is worth noting that we didn't define the type/schema of the document
while Scala is a strong type language. In other words, we have both the
type safe features of strong type language and the flexibility of dynamic
language in this JSON library.

If you try to access a non-exist field, 1JsUndefined` is returned.
{{{
scala> doc.book
res11: unicorn.json.JsValue = undefined
}}}
Although there are already several nice JSON libraries for Scala,
the JSON objects are immutable by design, which is a natural choice
for a functional language. For database, however, data mutation is necessary.
Therefore, `JsObject` and `JsArray` are mutable data structures. You can
set/add a field just like in JavaScript:
{{{
json.store.bicycle.color = "green"
}}}
To delete a field from `JsObject`, use remove method:
{{{
doc.store.book(0) remove "price"
}}}
It is same as setting it `JsUndefined`:
{{{
doc.store.book(0).price = `JsUndefined`
}}}
To delete an element from `JsArray`, the remove method will effectively
remove it from the array. However, setting an element to undefined
doesn't reduce the array size.
{{{
// delete the first element and array size is smaller
doc.store.book.remove(0)
// set the first element to undefined but array size keeps same
doc.store.book(0) = JsUndefined
}}}
It is also possible to append an element or another array to `JsArray`:
{{{
val a = JsArray(1, 2, 3, 4)
a += 5

a ++= JsArray(5, 6)
}}}
Common iterative operations such as `foreach`, `map`, `reduce` can be applied
to `JsArray` too.
{{{
doc.store.book.asInstanceOf[JsArray].foreach { book =>
 println(book.price)
}
}}}
Because Scala is a static language, it is impossible to know
`doc.store.book` is an array at compile time. So it is typed as
generic `JsValue`, which is the parent type of specific JSON data types.
Therefore, we use `asInstanceOf[JsArray]` to convert it to `JsArray`
in order to use `foreach`.
