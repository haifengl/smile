      "title": "read/write SLE4442 memory card with WinSCard API in c#",
      "body": "<h3>A bit of background information:</h3>\n\n<p>Inorder to read/write to SLE4442 memory cards, my app is currently using an Omnikey Cardman 3021 USB card reader, a Sumbsembly Smartcard API (external dll) which is capable of wrapping CT-API calls (directed to omnikey's dll) so that I can read/write the memory card in my c# app.\nThe only problem here is that Omnikey only provides a 32-bit dll of their CT-API. I asked if they are going to produce a 64-bit version, but they couldn't be bothered.</p>\n\n<h3>Current situation:</h3>\n\n<p>Inorder to make my application 64-bit capable, I must rewrite it using Windows WinSCard API. The problem here is that there are no specific examples on the web how to do it. Also getting hold of working APDU commands is nearly impossible, but I've managed to aquire two slightly different versions that sort of work.\nI have googled this a hundred times over many months and with what I have managed to gobble together I can finally read the SLE4442 memory card. But for the life of me I can't get writing to work.</p>\n\n<h3>The code:</h3>\n\n<p>I'm not going to post the entire code into this first post (if need be I can do it later or provide a link to the source code).\nBut I'll outline the basic steps.</p>\n\n<p>1) SCardEstablishContext</p>\n\n<p>2) Get the reader name via SCardListReaders</p>\n\n<p>3) SCardConnect</p>\n\n<p>4) Read entire memory with SCardTransmit and APDU new byte[] { 0xFF, 0xB0, 0, 0, 0 };</p>\n\n<p>5) Verify pin with SCardTransmit and APDU new byte[] { 0xFF, 0x20, 0, 0, 3, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF }; (Note that this does return 0x90;0x00 as a response, which means the verification should have been succesful)</p>\n\n<p>6) Try to write with ScardTransmit and APDU new byte[] { 0xFF, 0xD6, 0, 0, 50, 1 }; (try to write value 1 at memory position 50) - I have also tried using an APDU with the first parameter being 0x00 and/or the second byte being 0xD0. The response has never been 0x90;0x00 so I assume there is an error during writing, but I haven't been able to find any meaning to the error codes returned.</p>\n\n<h3>Possible causes:</h3>\n\n<p>Because I can read a memory card with the WinSCard API then it must be possible to also write to one (side note - the memory card(s) that I try to write to are in in working condition, I haven't locked them down by failing to verify the PIN 3 times).</p>\n\n<p>1) Maybe the write APDU command is wrong. Could be that the instruction byte (second byte) is incorrect, or the memory location uses some sort of an extended coding scheme.</p>\n\n<p>2) Maybe the verify command didn't actually verify. As in the command itself is fine, which is why 0x90 was returned, but I must call or setup something first.</p>\n\n<p>3) Just a hunch, but I think that this is the real culprit. While googling I did find some vague references to having to call the SCardControl method with parameter IOCTL_SMARTCARD_SET_CARD_TYPE and setting the card type to SLE4442. But again no working examples anywhere and my trial-and-error testing resulted in failures. I got \"One or more of the supplied parameters could not be properly interpreted.\" and some other error messages as well, can't remember what they all were. Assuming the code I copy-pasted from google code has the right descriptions for the error codes.</p>\n\n<h3>What I need:</h3>\n\n<p>What I need is someone to post or direct me to a site that has full+working code in c# for read/write SLE4442 using WinSCard API and it must work in both 32-bit and 64-bit enviroments.\nThe code doesn't have to be foolproof - eg. handling every possible error situation nicely. I should be able to do that myself. But if it is (including the APDU command result descriptions - eg. 0x90;0x00 is success, but 0x6B;0x4D is... etc...) then all the better.</p>\n"

Video tutorials and online blogs didn't address my questions. Some tutorials were complete overkill where authors got carried away with interfaces, reflection, dependency injection etc.</p>\n\n<p>As far as I can understand, in repository pattern I have to map classes generated by SQL metal to domain model classes. This makes sense. </p>\n\n<p>Next step is to write service layer which will instantiate objects from domain classes and pass them to a web layer. I'm unclear with what services should represent. For example, I have a customer service and its purpose is to deal with customer domain model. It has methods: FindAll(), FindByUsername(String username) etc. Should this service return shallow copies of customers or deep copies of customers where customer related information will be included?</p>\n\n<p>When we map SQL metal generated classes to domain model, we lose ability to use LINQ. Alternative is to service objects as IQuerable, but this doesn't seem to be right (just a gut feeling so far and I need to read up more on this). </p>\n\n<p>When it comes to saving classes, what should the service do? Take a domain model, invoke service, pass that to data access layer, convert it to entity and then use LINQ to persist the object? This seems like a lot of extra code.</p>\n\n<p>On the bright side, I see why there should be a clear separation between LINQ generated classes and domain model.</p>\n\n<p>I understand that question isn't structured well, but I guess if it was, I wouldn't be asking all this :) </p>\n\n<p>I have read quite a lot of repository pattern posts on here already.</p>\n"

What would be the most effective way to maintain a user's settings when upgrading the application and merging them with a new config file?</p>\n\n<p>My idea so far is to store a copy of the user's config file in a separate location and then on startup, check to see if the application has been upgraded by comparing the assembly version with a setting in the config file that contains the previous assembly version.

      "title": "Update App Widget On App Widget Click",
      "body": "<p>I'm trying to create an app widget with these three features:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>It should update part of its display, when some part of it is clicked.  </li>\n<li>The app widget is also to start an Activity, when another part of it is clicked.  </li>\n<li>I want to be able to have multiple instances of this app widget on screen at any time, each with their own display and click handling, such that when the \"update part\" is clicked on a given widget, only that widget's display is updated.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Other requirements include targeting API level 3.  So, those fancy new API 11 methods are off the table.</p>\n\n<p>I think I'm satisfied with my solution for the second requirement.</p>\n\n<p>For the first and third requirements, I've worked through examples from CommonsWare, J. Sharkey, Android In Action, and other resources.  None of them do just what I want, and some of them simply don't support multiple app widget instances.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried going down a few of the paths from the examples above, but so far I just end up with something that doesn't work as wanted.  The following code is one implementation example that satisfies requirement 2 just fine, and I think it should satisfy requirement 1, with the exception that I expect the clicks on text_view_2 to update all widget instances (instead of just one widget), but when I click on text_view_2 the app just does nothing, as confirmed by setting breakpoints at key lines of code.  (I was even finally smart enough to test the app on a real phone, instead of relying on the buggy emulators.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>AndroidManifest.xml:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;manifest\n    xmlns:android=\"https://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n    package=\"com.stackoverflow.q5661941\"\n    android:versionCode=\"1\"\n    android:versionName=\"1.0\"&gt;\n    &lt;uses-sdk\n        android:minSdkVersion=\"3\" /&gt;\n\n    &lt;application\n        android:icon=\"@drawable/icon\"\n        android:label=\"@string/app_name\"&gt;\n        &lt;activity\n            android:name=\".ViewNumberActivity\"\n            android:label=\"@string/app_name\"&gt;\n            &lt;intent-filter&gt;\n                &lt;action\n                    android:name=\"android.intent.action.MAIN\" /&gt;\n                &lt;category\n                    android:name=\"android.intent.category.LAUNCHER\" /&gt;\n            &lt;/intent-filter&gt;\n        &lt;/activity&gt;\n        &lt;receiver\n            android:name=\".MyAppWidgetProvider\"\n            android:label=\"My App Widget\"&gt;\n            &lt;intent-filter&gt;\n                &lt;action\n                    android:name=\"android.appwidget.action.APPWIDGET_UPDATE\" /&gt;\n            &lt;/intent-filter&gt;\n            &lt;meta-data\n                android:name=\"android.appwidget.provider\"\n                android:resource=\"@xml/my_app_widget\" /&gt;\n        &lt;/receiver&gt;\n        &lt;service\n            android:name=\".MyAppWidgetService\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/application&gt;\n&lt;/manifest&gt;</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>res/xml/my_app_widget.xml:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;appwidget-provider\n    xmlns:android=\"https://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n    android:minWidth=\"290dip\"\n    android:minHeight=\"72dip\"\n    android:updatePeriodMillis=\"1800000\"\n    android:initialLayout=\"@layout/my_app_widget_layout\" /&gt;</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>res/layout/my_app_widget_layout.xml</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;LinearLayout\n    xmlns:android=\"https://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n    android:orientation=\"horizontal\"\n    android:layout_width=\"fill_parent\"\n    android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n    android:padding=\"10dip\"\n    android:gravity=\"center\"\n    android:background=\"@android:color/white\"\n    android:weightSum=\"3\"&gt;\n    &lt;TextView\n        android:id=\"@+id/text_view_1\"\n        android:layout_width=\"0dip\"\n        android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n        android:layout_weight=\"1\"\n        android:text=\"Loading 1...\"\n        android:background=\"@android:color/black\"\n        android:textColor=\"@android:color/white\" /&gt;\n    &lt;TextView\n        android:id=\"@+id/text_view_2\"\n        android:layout_width=\"0dip\"\n        android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n        android:layout_weight=\"1\"\n        android:text=\"Change Number\"\n        android:background=\"@android:color/black\"\n        android:textColor=\"@android:color/white\" /&gt;\n&lt;/LinearLayout&gt;</code></pre>\n\n<pre><code>package com.stackoverflow.q5661941;\n\nimport android.app.Activity;\nimport android.appwidget.AppWidgetManager;\nimport android.content.Intent;\nimport android.os.Bundle;\nimport android.widget.TextView;\n\npublic class ViewNumberActivity extends Activity\n{\n  @Override\n  public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)\n  {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.main);\n\n    final Intent intent = getIntent();\n    final int incomingWidgetId =\n        intent != null\n            ?

      "body": "<p>Having used <strong>gprof</strong> and <strong>callgrind</strong> many times, I have reached the (obvious) conclusion that I cannot use them efficiently when dealing with large (as in a CAD program that loads a whole car) programs. I was thinking that maybe, I could use some C/C++ <strong>MACRO</strong> magic and somehow build a simple (but nice) logging mechanism. For example, one can call a function using the following macro:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#define CALL_FUN(fun_name, ...) \\\n    fun_name (__VA_ARGS__);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We could add some clocking/timing stuff before and after the function call, so that every function called with CALL_FUN gets timed, e.g</p>\n\n<pre><code>#define CALL_FUN(fun_name, ...) \\\n   time_t(&amp;t0);                 \\\n   fun_name (__VA_ARGS__);      \\\n   time_t(&amp;t1);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The variables t0, t1 could be found in a global logging object. That logging object can also hold the calling graph for each function called through <strong>CALL_FUN</strong>. Afterwards, that object can be written in a (specifically formatted) file, and be parsed from some other program. </p>\n\n<p>So here comes my (first) question: <em>Do you find this approach tractable ? If yes, how can it be enhanced, and if not, can you propose a better way to measure time and log callgraphs ?</em></p>\n\n<p>A collegue proposed another approach to deal with this problem, which is annotating with a specific comment each function (that we care to log). Then, during the make process, a special preprocessor must be run, parse each source file, add logging logic for each function we care to log, create a new source file with the newly added (parsing) code, and build that code instead. I guess that reading CALL_FUN... macros (my proposal) all over the place is not the best approach, and his approach would solve this problem. So what is your opinion about this approach?  </p>\n\n<p>PS: I am not well versed in the pitfalls of C/C++ MACROs, so if this can be developed using another approach, please say it so. </p>\n\n<p>Thank you. </p>\n"

But I dislike that solution, the plugin lost its modularity, and RSpec still returns me some bugs (he can't find the models/views/controllers located in the plugin...).\nSo am I the only one who try to test a Desert plugin (or even in a classic plugin) ? May anyone know those matters and get a solution ?</p>\n"
