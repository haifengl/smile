/**
 * Inverse multiquadric RBF. &phi;(r) = (r<sup>2</sup> + r<sup>2</sup><sub>0</sub>)<sup>-1/2</sup>
 * where r<sub>0</sub> is a scale factor. Although it sounds odd, the inverse
 * multiquadric gives results that are comparable to the multiquadric,
 * sometimes better. The reason is what really matters is smoothness, and
 * certain properties of the function's Fourier transform that are not very
 * different between the multiquadric and its reciprocal. The fact that one
 * increases monotonically and the other decreases turns out to be almost
 * irrelevant. Besides, inverse multiquadric will extrapolate any function to
 * zero far from the data.
 * <p>
 * In general, r<sub>0</sub> should be larger than the typical separation of
 * points but smaller than the "outer scale" or feature size of the function
 * to interplate. There can be several orders of magnitude difference between
 * the interpolation accuracy with a good choice for r<sub>0</sub>, versus a
 * poor choice, so it is definitely worth some experimentation. One way to
 * experiment is to construct an RBF interpolator omitting one data point
 * at a time and measuring the interpolation error at the omitted point.
