/**
 * Multiquadric RBF. &phi;(r) = (r<sup>2</sup> + r<sup>2</sup><sub>0</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>
 * where r<sub>0</sub> is a scale factor. Multiquadrics are said to be less
 * sensitive to the choice of r<sub>0</sub> than som other functional forms.
 * <p>
 * In general, r<sub>0</sub> should be larger than the typical separation of
 * points but smaller than the "outer scale" or feature size of the function
 * to interplate. There can be several orders of magnitude difference between
 * the interpolation accuracy with a good choice for r<sub>0</sub>, versus a
 * poor choice, so it is definitely worth some experimentation. One way to
 * experiment is to construct an RBF interpolator omitting one data point
 * at a time and measuring the interpolation error at the omitted point.
