/**
 * Bayesian information criterion (BIC) or Schwarz Criterion is a criterion for
 * model selection among a class of parametric models with different numbers
 * of parameters. Choosing a model to optimize BIC is a form of regularization.
 * <p>
 * When estimating model parameters using maximum likelihood estimation, it
 * is possible to increase the likelihood by adding additional parameters,
 * which may result in over-fitting. The BIC resolves this problem by
 * introducing a penalty term for the number of parameters in the model.
 * BIC is very closely related to the Akaike information criterion (AIC).
 * However, its penalty for additional parameters is stronger than that of AIC.
 * <p>
 * The formula for the BIC is BIC = L - 0.5 * v * log n where L is the
 * log-likelihood of estimated model, v is the number of free parameters
 * to be estimated in the model, and n is the number of samples.
 * <p>
 * Given any two estimated models, the model with the larger value of BIC is
 * the one to be preferred.
