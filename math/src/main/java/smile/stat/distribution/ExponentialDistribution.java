/**
 * An exponential distribution describes the times between events in a Poisson
 * process, in which events occur continuously and independently at a constant
 * average rate. Exponential variables can also be used to model situations
 * where certain events occur with a constant probability per unit length,
 * such as the distance between mutations on a DNA strand. In real world
 * scenarios, the assumption of a constant rate is rarely satisfied. But if
 * we focus on a time interval during which the rate is roughly constant, the
 * exponential distribution can be used as a good approximate model.
 * <p>
 * The exponential distribution may be viewed as a continuous counterpart of
 * the geometric distribution, which describes the number of Bernoulli trials
 * necessary for a discrete process to change state. In contrast,
 * the exponential distribution describes the time for a continuous process to
 * change state.
 * <p>
 * The probability density function of an exponential distribution is
 * f(x; &lambda;) = &lambda;e<sup>-&lambda;x</sup> for x &ge; 0. The cumulative
 * distribution function is given by F(x; &lambda;) = 1 - e<sup>-&lambda; x</sup>
 * for x &ge; 0. An important property of the exponential distribution is that
 * it is memoryless. This means that if a random variable T is exponentially
 * distributed, its conditional probability obeys
 * Pr(T &gt; s + t | T &gt; s) = Pr(T &gt; t) for all s, t &ge; 0.
 * <p>
 * In queuing theory, the service times of agents in a system are often modeled as
 * exponentially distributed variables. Reliability theory and reliability
 * engineering also make extensive use of the exponential distribution. Because
 * of the memoryless property of this distribution, it is well-suited to model
 * the constant hazard rate portion of the bathtub curve used in reliability
 * theory. The exponential distribution is however not appropriate to model
 * the overall lifetime of organisms or technical devices, because the "failure
 * rates" here are not constant: more failures occur for very young and for
 * very old systems.
