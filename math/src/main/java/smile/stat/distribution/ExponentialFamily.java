 * The exponential family is a class of probability distributions sharing
 * a certain form. The normal, exponential, gamma, chi-square, beta, Weibull
 * (if the shape parameter is known), Dirichlet, Bernoulli, binomial,
 * multinomial, Poisson, negative binomial, and geometric distributions
 * are all exponential families. The family of Pareto distributions with
 * a fixed minimum bound form an exponential family.
 * <p>
 * The Cauchy, Laplace, and uniform families of distributions are not
 * exponential families. The Weibull distribution is not an exponential
 * family unless the shape parameter is known.
 * <p>
 * The purpose of this interface is mainly to define the method M that is
 * the Maximization step in the EM algorithm. Note that distributuions of exponential
 * family has the close-form solutions in the EM algorithm. With this interface,
 * we may allow the mixture contains distributions of different form as long as
 * it is from exponential family.
