/**
 * The Weibull distribution is one of the most widely used lifetime distributions
 * in reliability engineering. It is a versatile distribution that can take on
 * the characteristics of other types of distributions, based on the value of
 * the shape parameter. The distribution has two parameters: k &gt; 0 is the shape
 * parameter and &lambda; &gt; 0 is the scale parameter of the distribution.
 * The probability density function is
 * f(x;&lambda;,k) = k/&lambda; (x/&lambda;)<sup>k-1</sup>e<sup>-(x/&lambda;)<sup>k</sup></sup>
 * for x &ge; 0.
 * <p>
 * The Weibull distribution is often used in the field of life data analysis
 * due to its flexibility - it can mimic the behavior of other statistical
 * distributions such as the normal and the exponential. If the failure rate
 * decreases over time, then k &lt; 1. If the failure rate is constant over time,
 * then k = 1. If the failure rate increases over time, then k &gt; 1.
 * <p>
 * An understanding of the failure rate may provide insight as to what is
 * causing the failures:
 * <ul>
 * <li> A decreasing failure rate would suggest "infant mortality". That is,
 * defective items fail early and the failure rate decreases over time as
 * they fall out of the population.
 * <li> A constant failure rate suggests that items are failing from random
 * events.
 * <li> An increasing failure rate suggests "wear out" - parts are more likely
 * to fail as time goes on.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Under certain parameterizations, the Weibull distribution reduces to several
 * other familiar distributions:
 * <ul>
 * <li> When k = 1, it is the exponential distribution.
 * <li> When k = 2, it becomes equivalent to the Rayleigh distribution,
 * which models the modulus of a two-dimensional uncorrelated bivariate
 * normal vector.
 * <li> When k = 3.4, it appears similar to the normal distribution.
 * <li> As k goes to infinity, the Weibull distribution asymptotically
 * approaches the Dirac delta function.
 * </ul>
