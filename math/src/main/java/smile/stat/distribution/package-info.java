/**
 * Probability distributions. In probability theory, a probability mass,
 * probability density, or probability distribution is a function that
 * describes the probability of a random variable taking certain values.
 * <p>
 * In the discrete case, one can easily assign a probability to each possible
 * value. In contrast, when a random variable takes values from a continuum,
 * probabilities are nonzero only if they refer to finite intervals.
 * <p>
 * If total order is defined for the random variable, the cumulative
 * distribution function gives the probability that the random variable
 * is not larger than a given value; it is the integral of the non-cumulative
 * distribution.
