 * Punctuation marks are symbols that indicate the structure and organization

 * <p>
 * The rules of punctuation vary with language, location, register and time
 * and are constantly evolving. Certain aspects of punctuation are stylistic
 * and are thus the author's (or editor's) choice. Tachygraphic language forms,
 * such as those used in online chat and text messages, may have wildly
 * different rules.
