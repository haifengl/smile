/**
 * Global Vectors for Word Representation.
 * <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/">GloVe</a> is an
 * unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations
 * for words.
 * <p>
 * GloVe is essentially a log-bilinear model with a weighted least-squares
 * objective. The main intuition underlying the model is the simple
 * observation that ratios of word-word co-occurrence probabilities
 * have the potential for encoding some form of meaning.
 * <p>
 * Training is performed on aggregated global word-word co-occurrence
 * statistics from a corpus. The training objective of GloVe is to learn
 * word vectors such that their dot product equals the logarithm of the
 * words' probability of co-occurrence. Owing to the fact that the logarithm
 * of a ratio equals the difference of logarithms, this objective associates
 * (the logarithm of) ratios of co-occurrence probabilities with vector
 * differences in the word vector space. Because these ratios can encode
 * some form of meaning, this information gets encoded as vector differences
 * as well.
