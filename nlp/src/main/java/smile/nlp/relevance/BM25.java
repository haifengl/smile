/**
 * The BM25 weighting scheme, often called Okapi weighting, after the system in
 * which it was first implemented, was developed as a way of building a
 * probabilistic model sensitive to term frequency and document length while
 * not introducing too many additional parameters into the model. It is not
 * a single function, but actually a whole family of scoring functions, with
 * slightly different components and parameters.
 * <p>
 * At the extreme values of the coefficient b, BM25 turns into ranking functions
 * known as BM11 (for b = 1) and BM15 (for b = 0). BM25F is a modification of
 * BM25 in which the document is considered to be composed of several fields
 * (such as headlines, main text, anchor text) with possibly different degrees
 * of importance.
 * <p>
 * BM25 and its newer variants represent state-of-the-art TF-IDF-like retrieval
 * functions used in document retrieval, such as web search.
