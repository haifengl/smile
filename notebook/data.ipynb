    "\n",
    "A feature is an individual measurable property of a phenomenon being observed. Features are also called explanatory variables, independent variables, predictors, regressors, etc. Any attribute could be a feature, but choosing informative, discriminating and independent features is a crucial step for effective algorithms in machine learning. Features are usually numeric and a set of numeric features can be conveniently described by a feature vector. Structural features such as strings, sequences and graphs are also used in areas such as natural language processing, computational biology, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge of the data to create features that make machine learning algorithms work. Feature engineering is fundamental to the application of machine learning, and is both difficult and expensive. It requires the experimentation of multiple possibilities and the combination of automated techniques with the intuition and knowledge of the domain expert."

    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, there are two major types of attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Qualitative variables*:\n",
    "The data values are non-numeric categories. Examples: Blood type, Gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Quantitative variables*:\n",
    "The data values are counts or numerical measurements. A quantitative variable can be either discrete such as the number of students receiving an 'A' in a class, or continuous such as GPA, salary and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of classifying data is by the measurement scales. In statistics, there are four generally used measurement scales:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Nominal data*:\n",
    "Data values are non-numeric group labels. For example, Gender variable can be defined as male = 0 and female =1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Ordinal data*:\n",
    "Data values are categorical and may be ranked in some numerically meaningful way. For example, strongly disagree to strong agree may be defined as 1 to 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Continuous data*:\n",
    "-- *Interval data*: Data values are ranged in a real interval, which can be as large as from negative infinity to positive infinity. The difference between two values are meaningful, however, the ratio of two interval data is not meaningful. For example temperature, IQ.\n",
    "-- *Ratio data*: Both difference and ratio of two values are meaningful. For example, salary, weight.\n",
    "Many machine learning algorithms can only handle numeric attributes while a few such as decision trees can process nominal attribute directly. Date attribute is useful in plotting. With some feature engineering, values like day of week can be used as nominal attribute. String attribute could be used in text mining and natural language processing."
