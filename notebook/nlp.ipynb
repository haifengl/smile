    "# Natural Language Processing\n",
    "Natural language processing (NLP) is about developing applications and services that are able to understand human languages. Advanced high level NLP tasks include speech recognition, machine translation, natural language understanding, natural language generation, dialog system, etc. In Smile, we focus on low and intermediate level NLP tasks such as sentence breaking, stemming, n-gram, part-of-speech recognition, keyword detection, named entity recognition, etc. Statistical natural language processing relies heavily on machine learning."

Normalization is typically applied to text first to remove unwanted variations. Normalization may range from light textual cleanup such as compressing whitespace to more aggressive and knowledge-intensive forms like standardizing date formats or expanding abbreviations. The nature and extent of normalization, as well as whether it is most appropriate to apply on the document, sentence, or token level, must be determined in the context of a specific application.\n",

    "In many NLP tasks, the input text has to be divided into sentences. However, sentence boundary identification is challenging because punctuation marks are often ambiguous. In English, punctuation marks that usually appear at the end of a sentence may not indicate the end of a sentence. The period is the worst offender. A period can end a sentence but it can also be part of an abbreviation or acronym, an ellipsis, a decimal number, or part of a bracket of periods surrounding a Roman numeral. A period can even act both as the end of an abbreviation and the end of a sentence at the same time. Other the other hand, some poems may not contain any sentence punctuation at all.\n",

However, some written languages like Chinese, Japanese and Thai do not mark word boundaries by spaces. In those languages word segmentation is a significant task requiring knowledge of the vocabulary and morphology of words in the language.\n",

    "The method words(filter) assumes that an English text has already been segmented into sentences and splits a sentence into tokens. Any periods – apart from those at the end of a string or before newline – are assumed to be part of the word they are attached to (e.g. for abbreviations, etc), and are not separately tokenized. Most punctuation is split from adjoining words. Verb contractions and the Anglo-Saxon genitive of nouns are split into their component morphemes, and each morpheme is tagged separately. The below example splits a set of sentences and flat out the results into one array."

    "## Stemming\n",
    "For grammatical reasons, we use different forms of a word, such as go, goes, and went. Additionally, there are families of derivationally related words with similar meanings, such as democracy, democratic, and democratization. For many machine learning algorithms, it is good to reduce inflectional forms and sometimes derivationally related forms of a word to a common base form to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stemming is a crude heuristic process that chops off the ends of words in the hope of achieving this goal correctly most of the time, and often includes the removal of derivational affixes. The most common algorithm for stemming English is Porter's algorithm. Porter's algorithm is based on the idea that the suffixes in the English language are mostly made up of a combination of smaller and simpler suffixes. As a linear step stemmer, Porter's algorithm consists of 5 phases of word reductions, applied sequentially. Within each step, if a suffix rule matched to a word, then the conditions attached to that rule are tested on what would be the resulting stem, if that suffix was removed, in the way defined by the rule. Once a Rule passes its conditions and is accepted the rule fires and the suffix is removed and control moves to the next step. If the rule is not accepted then the next rule in the step is tested, until either a rule from that step fires and control passes to the next step or there are no more rules in that step whence control moves to the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another popular stemming algorithm is the Paice/Husk Lancaster algorithm, which is a conflation based iterative stemmer. The stemmer, although remaining efficient and easily implemented, is known to be very strong and aggressive. The stemmer utilizes a single table of rules, each of which may specify the removal or replacement of an ending. The implementation LancasterStemmer allows the user to load customized rules."

A overloaded version of `vectorize()` converts a binary bag of words (`Set[String]`) to a sparse integer vector, which elements are the indices of presented feature tokens in ascending order.

    "So far, we have treat words to be independent. But natural languages include the expressions consisting of two or more words that correspond to some conventional way of saying things. A collocation is a sequence of words or terms that co-occur more often than would be expected by chance. There are about six main types of collocations: adjective+noun, noun+noun, verb+noun, adverb+adjective, verbs+prepositional, and verb+adverb. Collocation extraction employs various computational linguistics techniques to find collocations in a document or corpus that are statistically significant.\n",

Commonly listed English parts of speech are noun, verb, adjective, adverb, pronoun, preposition, conjunction, interjection, etc. In Smile, we use the Penn Treebank PoS tag set.
