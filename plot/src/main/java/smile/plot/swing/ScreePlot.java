/**
 * In multivariate statistics, a scree plot is a line plot of the eigenvalues
 * of factors or principal components in an analysis. The scree plot is used
 * to determine the number of factors to retain in an exploratory factor
 * analysis (FA) or principal components to keep in a principal component
 * analysis (PCA). The procedure of finding statistically significant
 * factors or components using a scree plot is also known as a scree test.
 * <p>
 * A scree plot always displays the eigenvalues in a downward curve,
 * ordering the eigenvalues from largest to smallest. According to the
 * scree test, the "elbow" of the graph where the eigenvalues seem to
 * level off is found and factors or components to the left of this point
 * should be retained as significant. It is named after its resemblance
 * to scree after its elbow.
