  /** K-nearest neighbor classifier.
    * The k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN) is
    * a method for classifying objects by a majority vote of its neighbors,
    * with the object being assigned to the class most common amongst its k
    * nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small).
    * k-NN is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning where the
    * function is only approximated locally and all computation
    * is deferred until classification.
    *
    * The best choice of k depends upon the data; generally, larger values of
    * k reduce the effect of noise on the classification, but make boundaries
    * between classes less distinct. A good k can be selected by various
    * heuristic techniques, e.g. cross-validation. In binary problems, it is
    * helpful to choose k to be an odd number as this avoids tied votes.
    *
    * A drawback to the basic majority voting classification is that the classes
    * with the more frequent instances tend to dominate the prediction of the
    * new object, as they tend to come up in the k nearest neighbors when
    * the neighbors are computed due to their large number. One way to overcome
    * this problem is to weight the classification taking into account the
    * distance from the test point to each of its k nearest neighbors.
    *
    * Often, the classification accuracy of k-NN can be improved significantly
    * if the distance metric is learned with specialized algorithms such as
    * Large Margin Nearest Neighbor or Neighborhood Components Analysis.
    *
    * Nearest neighbor rules in effect compute the decision boundary in an
    * implicit manner. It is also possible to compute the decision boundary
    * itself explicitly, and to do so in an efficient manner so that the
    * computational complexity is a function of the boundary complexity.
    *
    * The nearest neighbor algorithm has some strong consistency results. As
    * the amount of data approaches infinity, the algorithm is guaranteed to
    * yield an error rate no worse than twice the Bayes error rate (the minimum
    * achievable error rate given the distribution of the data). k-NN is
    * guaranteed to approach the Bayes error rate, for some value of k (where k
    * increases as a function of the number of data points).

  /** Logistic regression.
    * Logistic regression (logit model) is a generalized
    * linear model used for binomial regression. Logistic regression applies
    * maximum likelihood estimation after transforming the dependent into
    * a logit variable. A logit is the natural log of the odds of the dependent
    * equaling a certain value or not (usually 1 in binary logistic models,
    * the highest value in multinomial models). In this way, logistic regression
    * estimates the odds of a certain event (value) occurring.
    *
    * Goodness-of-fit tests such as the likelihood ratio test are available
    * as indicators of model appropriateness, as is the Wald statistic to test
    * the significance of individual independent variables.
    *
    * Logistic regression has many analogies to ordinary least squares (OLS)
    * regression. Unlike OLS regression, however, logistic regression does not
    * assume linearity of relationship between the raw values of the independent
    * variables and the dependent, does not require normally distributed variables,
    * does not assume homoscedasticity, and in general has less stringent
    * requirements.
    *
    * Compared with linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression has several
    * advantages:
    *
    *  - It is more robust: the independent variables don't have to be normally
    *    distributed, or have equal variance in each group
    *
    *  - It does not assume a linear relationship between the independent
    *    variables and dependent variable.
    *
    *  - It may handle nonlinear effects since one can add explicit interaction
    *    and power terms.
    *
    * However, it requires much more data to achieve stable, meaningful results.
    *
    * Logistic regression also has strong connections with neural network and
    * maximum entropy modeling. For example, binary logistic regression is
    * equivalent to a one-layer, single-output neural network with a logistic
    * activation function trained under log loss. Similarly, multinomial logistic
    * regression is equivalent to a one-layer, softmax-output neural network.
    *
    * Logistic regression estimation also obeys the maximum entropy principle, and
    * thus logistic regression is sometimes called "maximum entropy modeling",
    * and the resulting classifier the "maximum entropy classifier".

  /** Maximum Entropy Classifier.
    * Maximum entropy is a technique for learning
    * probability distributions from data. In maximum entropy models, the
    * observed data itself is assumed to be the testable information. Maximum
    * entropy models don't assume anything about the probability distribution
    * other than what have been observed and always choose the most uniform
    * distribution subject to the observed constraints.
    *
    * Basically, maximum entropy classifier is another name of multinomial logistic
    * regression applied to categorical independent variables, which are
    * converted to binary dummy variables. Maximum entropy models are widely
    * used in natural language processing.  Here, we provide an implementation
    * which assumes that binary features are stored in a sparse array, of which
    * entries are the indices of nonzero features.

  /** Multilayer perceptron neural network.
    * An MLP consists of several layers of nodes, interconnected through weighted
    * acyclic arcs from each preceding layer to the following, without lateral or
    * feedback connections. Each node calculates a transformed weighted linear
    * combination of its inputs (output activations from the preceding layer), with
    * one of the weights acting as a trainable bias connected to a constant input.
    * The transformation, called activation function, is a bounded non-decreasing
    * (non-linear) function, such as the sigmoid functions (ranges from 0 to 1).
    * Another popular activation function is hyperbolic tangent which is actually
    * equivalent to the sigmoid function in shape but ranges from -1 to 1.
    * More specialized activation functions include radial basis functions which
    * are used in RBF networks.
    *
    * The representational capabilities of a MLP are determined by the range of
    * mappings it may implement through weight variation. Single layer perceptrons
    * are capable of solving only linearly separable problems. With the sigmoid
    * function as activation function, the single-layer network is identical
    * to the logistic regression model.
    *
    * The universal approximation theorem for neural networks states that every
    * continuous function that maps intervals of real numbers to some output
    * interval of real numbers can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a
    * multi-layer perceptron with just one hidden layer. This result holds only
    * for restricted classes of activation functions, which are extremely complex
    * and NOT smooth for subtle mathematical reasons. On the other hand, smoothness
    * is important for gradient descent learning. Besides, the proof is not
    * constructive regarding the number of neurons required or the settings of
    * the weights. Therefore, complex systems will have more layers of neurons
    * with some having increased layers of input neurons and output neurons
    * in practice.
    *
    * The most popular algorithm to train MLPs is back-propagation, which is a
    * gradient descent method. Based on chain rule, the algorithm propagates the
    * error back through the network and adjusts the weights of each connection in
    * order to reduce the value of the error function by some small amount.
    * For this reason, back-propagation can only be applied on networks with
    * differentiable activation functions.
    *
    * During error back propagation, we usually times the gradient with a small
    * number &eta;, called learning rate, which is carefully selected to ensure
    * that the network converges to a local minimum of the error function
    * fast enough, without producing oscillations. One way to avoid oscillation
    * at large &eta;, is to make the change in weight dependent on the past weight
    * change by adding a momentum term.
    *
    * Although the back-propagation algorithm may performs gradient
    * descent on the total error of all instances in a batch way,
    * the learning rule is often applied to each instance separately in an online
    * way or stochastic way. There exists empirical indication that the stochastic
    * way results in faster convergence.
    *
    * In practice, the problem of over-fitting has emerged. This arises in
    * convoluted or over-specified systems when the capacity of the network
    * significantly exceeds the needed free parameters. There are two general
    * approaches for avoiding this problem: The first is to use cross-validation
    * and similar techniques to check for the presence of over-fitting and
    * optimally select hyper-parameters such as to minimize the generalization
    * error. The second is to use some form of regularization, which emerges
    * naturally in a Bayesian framework, where the regularization can be
    * performed by selecting a larger prior probability over simpler models;
    * but also in statistical learning theory, where the goal is to minimize over
    * the "empirical risk" and the "structural risk".
    *
    * For neural networks, the input patterns usually should be scaled/standardized.
    * Commonly, each input variable is scaled into interval [0, 1] or to have
    * mean 0 and standard deviation 1.
    *
    * For penalty functions and output units, the following natural pairings are
    * recommended:
    *
    *  - linear output units and a least squares penalty function.
    *  - a two-class cross-entropy penalty function and a logistic
    *    activation function.
    *  - a multi-class cross-entropy penalty function and a softmax
    *    activation function.
    *
    * By assigning a softmax activation function on the output layer of
    * the neural network for categorical target variables, the outputs
    * can be interpreted as posterior probabilities, which are very useful.
    *

  /** Radial basis function networks.
    * A radial basis function network is an
    * artificial neural network that uses radial basis functions as activation
    * functions. It is a linear combination of radial basis functions. They are
    * used in function approximation, time series prediction, and control.
    *
    * In its basic form, radial basis function network is in the form
    *
    * y(x) = &Sigma; w<sub>i</sub> &phi;(||x-c<sub>i</sub>||)
    *
    * where the approximating function y(x) is represented as a sum of N radial
    * basis functions &phi;, each associated with a different center c<sub>i</sub>,
    * and weighted by an appropriate coefficient w<sub>i</sub>. For distance,
    * one usually chooses Euclidean distance. The weights w<sub>i</sub> can
    * be estimated using the matrix methods of linear least squares, because
    * the approximating function is linear in the weights.
    *
    * The centers c<sub>i</sub> can be randomly selected from training data,
    * or learned by some clustering method (e.g. k-means), or learned together
    * with weight parameters undergo a supervised learning processing
    * (e.g. error-correction learning).
    *
    * The popular choices for &phi; comprise the Gaussian function and the so
    * called thin plate splines. The advantage of the thin plate splines is that
    * their conditioning is invariant under scalings. Gaussian, multi-quadric
    * and inverse multi-quadric are infinitely smooth and and involve a scale
    * or shape parameter, r<sub><small>0</small></sub> &gt; 0. Decreasing
    * r<sub><small>0</small></sub> tends to flatten the basis function. For a
    * given function, the quality of approximation may strongly depend on this
    * parameter. In particular, increasing r<sub><small>0</small></sub> has the
    * effect of better conditioning (the separation distance of the scaled points
    * increases).
    *
    * A variant on RBF networks is normalized radial basis function (NRBF)
    * networks, in which we require the sum of the basis functions to be unity.
    * NRBF arises more naturally from a Bayesian statistical perspective. However,
    * there is no evidence that either the NRBF method is consistently superior
    * to the RBF method, or vice versa.
    *
    * SVMs with Gaussian kernel have similar structure as RBF networks with

    * solves the network complexity problem since the size of the hidden layer
    * is obtained as the result of the QP procedure. Hidden neurons and
    * support vectors correspond to each other, so the center problems of
    * the RBF network is also solved, as the support vectors serve as the
    * basis function centers. It was reported that with similar number of support

  /** Support vector machines for classification. The basic support vector machine
    * is a binary linear classifier which chooses the hyperplane that represents
    * the largest separation, or margin, between the two classes. If such a
    * hyperplane exists, it is known as the maximum-margin hyperplane and the
    * linear classifier it defines is known as a maximum margin classifier.
    *
    * If there exists no hyperplane that can perfectly split the positive and
    * negative instances, the soft margin method will choose a hyperplane
    * that splits the instances as cleanly as possible, while still maximizing
    * the distance to the nearest cleanly split instances.
    *
    * The nonlinear SVMs are created by applying the kernel trick to
    * maximum-margin hyperplanes. The resulting algorithm is formally similar,
    * except that every dot product is replaced by a nonlinear kernel function.
    * This allows the algorithm to fit the maximum-margin hyperplane in a
    * transformed feature space. The transformation may be nonlinear and
    * the transformed space be high dimensional. For example, the feature space
    * corresponding Gaussian kernel is a Hilbert space of infinite dimension.
    * Thus though the classifier is a hyperplane in the high-dimensional feature
    * space, it may be nonlinear in the original input space. Maximum margin
    * classifiers are well regularized, so the infinite dimension does not spoil
    * the results.
    *
    * The effectiveness of SVM depends on the selection of kernel, the kernel's
    * parameters, and soft margin parameter C. Given a kernel, best combination
    * of C and kernel's parameters is often selected by a grid-search with
    * cross validation.
    *
    * The dominant approach for creating multi-class SVMs is to reduce the
    * single multi-class problem into multiple binary classification problems.
    * Common methods for such reduction is to build binary classifiers which
    * distinguish between (i) one of the labels to the rest (one-versus-all)
    * or (ii) between every pair of classes (one-versus-one). Classification
    * of new instances for one-versus-all case is done by a winner-takes-all
    * strategy, in which the classifier with the highest output function assigns
    * the class. For the one-versus-one approach, classification
    * is done by a max-wins voting strategy, in which every classifier assigns
    * the instance to one of the two classes, then the vote for the assigned
    * class is increased by one vote, and finally the class with most votes

    * splitting the training set into subsets based on an attribute value
    * test. This process is repeated on each derived subset in a recursive
    * manner called recursive partitioning. The recursion is completed when
    * the subset at a node all has the same value of the target variable,
    * or when splitting no longer adds value to the predictions.
    *
    * The algorithms that are used for constructing decision trees usually
    * work top-down by choosing a variable at each step that is the next best
    * variable to use in splitting the set of items. "Best" is defined by how
    * well the variable splits the set into homogeneous subsets that have
    * the same value of the target variable. Different algorithms use different
    * formulae for measuring "best". Used by the CART algorithm, Gini impurity
    * is a measure of how often a randomly chosen element from the set would
    * be incorrectly labeled if it were randomly labeled according to the
    * distribution of labels in the subset. Gini impurity can be computed by
    * summing the probability of each item being chosen times the probability
    * of a mistake in categorizing that item. It reaches its minimum (zero) when
    * all cases in the node fall into a single target category. Information gain
    * is another popular measure, used by the ID3, C4.5 and C5.0 algorithms.
    * Information gain is based on the concept of entropy used in information
    * theory. For categorical variables with different number of levels, however,
    * information gain are biased in favor of those attributes with more levels.
    * Instead, one may employ the information gain ratio, which solves the drawback
    * of information gain.
    *
    * Classification and Regression Tree techniques have a number of advantages
    * over many of those alternative techniques.
    *  - '''Simple to understand and interpret:'''
    * In most cases, the interpretation of results summarized in a tree is
    * very simple. This simplicity is useful not only for purposes of rapid
    * classification of new observations, but can also often yield a much simpler
    * "model" for explaining why observations are classified or predicted in a
    * particular manner.
    *  - '''Able to handle both numerical and categorical data:'''
    * Other techniques are usually specialized in analyzing datasets that
    * have only one type of variable.
    *  - '''Nonparametric and nonlinear:'''
    * The final results of using tree methods for classification or regression
    * can be summarized in a series of (usually few) logical if-then conditions
    * (tree nodes). Therefore, there is no implicit assumption that the underlying
    * relationships between the predictor variables and the dependent variable
    * are linear, follow some specific non-linear link function, or that they
    * are even monotonic in nature. Thus, tree methods are particularly well
    * suited for data mining tasks, where there is often little a priori
    * knowledge nor any coherent set of theories or predictions regarding which
    * variables are related and how. In those types of data analytics, tree
    * methods can often reveal simple relationships between just a few variables
    * that could have easily gone unnoticed using other analytic techniques.
    *
    * One major problem with classification and regression trees is their high
    * variance. Often a small change in the data can result in a very different
    * series of splits, making interpretation somewhat precarious. Besides,
    * decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that cause over-fitting.
    * Mechanisms such as pruning are necessary to avoid this problem.
    * Another limitation of trees is the lack of smoothness of the prediction
    * surface.
    *
    * Some techniques such as bagging, boosting, and random forest use more than
    * one decision tree for their analysis.

  /** Random forest for classification. Random forest is an ensemble classifier
    * that consists of many decision trees and outputs the majority vote of
    * individual trees. The method combines bagging idea and the random
    * selection of features.
    *
    * Each tree is constructed using the following algorithm:
    *
    *  i. If the number of cases in the training set is N, randomly sample N cases
    * with replacement from the original data. This sample will
    * be the training set for growing the tree.
    *  i. If there are M input variables, a number m &lt;&lt; M is specified such
    * that at each node, m variables are selected at random out of the M and
    * the best split on these m is used to split the node. The value of m is
    * held constant during the forest growing.
    *  i. Each tree is grown to the largest extent possible. There is no pruning.
    *
    * The advantages of random forest are:
    *
    *  - For many data sets, it produces a highly accurate classifier.
    *  - It runs efficiently on large data sets.
    *  - It can handle thousands of input variables without variable deletion.
    *  - It gives estimates of what variables are important in the classification.
    *  - It generates an internal unbiased estimate of the generalization error
    * as the forest building progresses.
    *  - It has an effective method for estimating missing data and maintains
    * accuracy when a large proportion of the data are missing.
    *
    * The disadvantages are
    *
    *  - Random forests are prone to over-fitting for some datasets. This is
    * even more pronounced on noisy data.
    *  - For data including categorical variables with different number of
    * levels, random forests are biased in favor of those attributes with more
    * levels. Therefore, the variable importance scores from random forest are

  /** Gradient boosted classification trees.
    *
    * Generic gradient boosting at the t-th step would fit a regression tree to
    * pseudo-residuals. Let J be the number of its leaves. The tree partitions
    * the input space into J disjoint regions and predicts a constant value in
    * each region. The parameter J controls the maximum allowed
    * level of interaction between variables in the model. With J = 2 (decision
    * stumps), no interaction between variables is allowed. With J = 3 the model
    * may include effects of the interaction between up to two variables, and
    * so on. Hastie et al. comment that typically 4 &le; J &le; 8 work well
    * for boosting and results are fairly insensitive to the choice of in
    * this range, J = 2 is insufficient for many applications, and J &gt; 10 is
    * unlikely to be required.
    *
    * Fitting the training set too closely can lead to degradation of the model's
    * generalization ability. Several so-called regularization techniques reduce
    * this over-fitting effect by constraining the fitting procedure.
    * One natural regularization parameter is the number of gradient boosting
    * iterations T (i.e. the number of trees in the model when the base learner
    * is a decision tree). Increasing T reduces the error on training set,
    * but setting it too high may lead to over-fitting. An optimal value of T
    * is often selected by monitoring prediction error on a separate validation
    * data set.
    *
    * Another regularization approach is the shrinkage which times a parameter
    * &eta; (called the "learning rate") to update term.
    * Empirically it has been found that using small learning rates (such as
    * &eta; &lt; 0.1) yields dramatic improvements in model's generalization ability
    * over gradient boosting without shrinking (&eta; = 1). However, it comes at
    * the price of increasing computational time both during training and
    * prediction: lower learning rate requires more iterations.
    *
    * Soon after the introduction of gradient boosting Friedman proposed a
    * minor modification to the algorithm, motivated by Breiman's bagging method.
    * Specifically, he proposed that at each iteration of the algorithm, a base
    * learner should be fit on a subSample of the training set drawn at random
    * without replacement. Friedman observed a substantial improvement in
    * gradient boosting's accuracy with this modification.
    *
    * SubSample size is some constant fraction f of the size of the training set.
    * When f = 1, the algorithm is deterministic and identical to the one
    * described above. Smaller values of f introduce randomness into the
    * algorithm and help prevent over-fitting, acting as a kind of regularization.
    * The algorithm also becomes faster, because regression trees have to be fit
    * to smaller dataSets at each iteration. Typically, f is set to 0.5, meaning
    * that one half of the training set is used to build each base learner.
    *
    * Also, like in bagging, sub-sampling allows one to define an out-of-bag
    * estimate of the prediction performance improvement by evaluating predictions
    * on those observations which were not used in the building of the next
    * base learner. Out-of-bag estimates help avoid the need for an independent
    * validation dataset, but often underestimate actual performance improvement
    * and the optimal number of iterations.
    *
    * Gradient tree boosting implementations often also use regularization by
    * limiting the minimum number of observations in trees' terminal nodes.
    * It's used in the tree building process by ignoring any splits that lead
    * to nodes containing fewer than this number of training set instances.
    * Imposing this limit helps to reduce variance in predictions at leaves.

    * in the sense that subsequent classifiers built are tweaked in favor of those
    * instances misclassified by previous classifiers. AdaBoost is sensitive to
    * noisy data and outliers. However in some problems it can be less susceptible
    * to the over-fitting problem than most learning algorithms.
    *
    * AdaBoost calls a weak classifier repeatedly in a series of rounds from
    * total T classifiers. For each call a distribution of weights is updated
    * that indicates the importance of examples in the data set for the
    * classification. On each round, the weights of each incorrectly classified
    * example are increased (or alternatively, the weights of each correctly
    * classified example are decreased), so that the new classifier focuses more
    * on those examples.
    *
    * The basic AdaBoost algorithm is only for binary classification problem.
    * For multi-class classification, a common approach is reducing the
