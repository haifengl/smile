/** Clustering analysis. Clustering is the assignment of a set of observations
  * into subsets (called clusters) so that observations in the same cluster are
  * similar in some sense. Clustering is a method of unsupervised learning,
  * and a common technique for statistical data analysis used in many fields.
  *
  * Hierarchical algorithms find successive clusters using previously
  * established clusters. These algorithms usually are either agglomerative
  * ("bottom-up") or divisive ("top-down"). Agglomerative algorithms begin
  * with each element as a separate cluster and merge them into successively
  * larger clusters. Divisive algorithms begin with the whole set and proceed
  * to divide it into successively smaller clusters.
  *
  * Partitional algorithms typically determine all clusters at once, but can
  * also be used as divisive algorithms in the hierarchical clustering.
  * Many partitional clustering algorithms require the specification of
  * the number of clusters to produce in the input data set, prior to
  * execution of the algorithm. Barring knowledge of the proper value
  * beforehand, the appropriate value must be determined, a problem on
  * its own for which a number of techniques have been developed.
  *
  * Density-based clustering algorithms are devised to discover
  * arbitrary-shaped clusters. In this approach, a cluster is regarded as
  * a region in which the density of data objects exceeds a threshold.
  *
  * Subspace clustering methods look for clusters that can only be seen in
  * a particular projection (subspace, manifold) of the data. These methods
  * thus can ignore irrelevant attributes. The general problem is also known
  * as Correlation clustering while the special case of axis-parallel subspaces
  * is also known as two-way clustering, co-clustering or biclustering in
  * bioinformatics: in these methods not only the objects are clustered but
  * also the features of the objects, i.e., if the data is represented in
  * a data matrix, the rows and columns are clustered simultaneously. They
  * usually do not however work with arbitrary feature combinations as in general
  * subspace methods.

    * Although finding an exact solution to the k-means problem for arbitrary
    * input is NP-hard, the standard approach to finding an approximate solution
    * (often called Lloyd's algorithm or the k-means algorithm) is used widely
    * and frequently finds reasonable solutions quickly.
    *
    * However, the k-means algorithm has at least two major theoretic shortcomings:
    *
    *  - First, it has been shown that the worst case running time of the
    * algorithm is super-polynomial in the input size.
    *  - Second, the approximation found can be arbitrarily bad with respect
    * to the objective function compared to the optimal learn.
    *
    * In this implementation, we use k-means++ which addresses the second of these
    * obstacles by specifying a procedure to initialize the cluster centers before
    * proceeding with the standard k-means optimization iterations. With the
    * k-means++ initialization, the algorithm is guaranteed to find a solution
    * that is O(log k) competitive to the optimal k-means solution.
    *
    * We also use k-d trees to speed up each k-means step as described in the filter
    * algorithm by Kanungo, et al.
    *
    * K-means is a hard clustering method, i.e. each sample is assigned to
    * a specific cluster. In contrast, soft clustering, e.g. the
    * Expectation-Maximization algorithm for Gaussian mixtures, assign samples
    * to different clusters with different probabilities.

  /** Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise.
    * DBSCAN finds a number of clusters starting from the estimated density
    * distribution of corresponding nodes.
    *
    * DBSCAN requires two parameters: radius (i.e. neighborhood radius) and the
    * number of minimum points required to form a cluster (minPts). It starts
    * with an arbitrary starting point that has not been visited. This point's
    * neighborhood is retrieved, and if it contains sufficient number of points,
    * a cluster is started. Otherwise, the point is labeled as noise. Note that
    * this point might later be found in a sufficiently sized radius-environment
    * of a different point and hence be made part of a cluster.
    *
    * If a point is found to be part of a cluster, its neighborhood is also
    * part of that cluster. Hence, all points that are found within the
    * neighborhood are added, as is their own neighborhood. This process
    * continues until the cluster is completely found. Then, a new unvisited point
    * is retrieved and processed, leading to the discovery of a further cluster
    * of noise.
    *
    * DBSCAN visits each point of the database, possibly multiple times (e.g.,
    * as candidates to different clusters). For practical considerations, however,
    * the time complexity is mostly governed by the number of nearest neighbor
    * queries. DBSCAN executes exactly one such query for each point, and if
    * an indexing structure is used that executes such a neighborhood query
    * in O(log n), an overall runtime complexity of O(n log n) is obtained.
    *
    * DBSCAN has many advantages such as
    *
    *  - DBSCAN does not need to know the number of clusters in the data
    * a priori, as opposed to k-means.
    *  - DBSCAN can find arbitrarily shaped clusters. It can even find clusters
    * completely surrounded by (but not connected to) a different cluster.
    * Due to the MinPts parameter, the so-called single-link effect
    * (different clusters being connected by a thin line of points) is reduced.
    *  - DBSCAN has a notion of noise.
    *  - DBSCAN requires just two parameters and is mostly insensitive to the
    * ordering of the points in the database. (Only points sitting on the
    * edge of two different clusters might swap cluster membership if the
    * ordering of the points is changed, and the cluster assignment is unique
    * only up to isomorphism.)
    *
    * On the other hand, DBSCAN has the disadvantages of
    *
    *  - In high dimensional space, the data are sparse everywhere
    * because of the curse of dimensionality. Therefore, DBSCAN doesn't
    * work well on high-dimensional data in general.
    *  - DBSCAN does not respond well to data sets with varying densities.

  /** Spectral Clustering. Given a set of data points, the similarity matrix may
    * be defined as a matrix S where S<sub>ij</sub> represents a measure of the
    * similarity between points. Spectral clustering techniques make use of the
    * spectrum of the similarity matrix of the data to perform dimensionality
    * reduction for clustering in fewer dimensions. Then the clustering will
    * be performed in the dimension-reduce space, in which clusters of non-convex
    * shape may become tight. There are some intriguing similarities between
    * spectral clustering methods and kernel PCA, which has been empirically
    * observed to perform clustering.
