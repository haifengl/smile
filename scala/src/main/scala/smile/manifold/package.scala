/** Manifold learning finds a low-dimensional basis for describing
  * high-dimensional data. Manifold learning is a popular approach to nonlinear
  * dimensionality reduction. Algorithms for this task are based on the idea
  * that the dimensionality of many data sets is only artificially high; though
  * each data point consists of perhaps thousands of features, it may be
  * described as a function of only a few underlying parameters. That is, the
  * data points are actually samples from a low-dimensional manifold that is
  * embedded in a high-dimensional space. Manifold learning algorithms attempt
  * to uncover these parameters in order to find a low-dimensional representation
  * of the data.
  *
  * Some prominent approaches are locally linear embedding
  * (LLE), Hessian LLE, Laplacian eigenmaps, and LTSA. These techniques
  * construct a low-dimensional data representation using a cost function
  * that retains local properties of the data, and can be viewed as defining
  * a graph-based kernel for Kernel PCA. More recently, techniques have been
  * proposed that, instead of defining a fixed kernel, try to learn the kernel
  * using semidefinite programming. The most prominent example of such a
  * technique is maximum variance unfolding (MVU). The central idea of MVU
  * is to exactly preserve all pairwise distances between nearest neighbors
  * (in the inner product space), while maximizing the distances between points
  * that are not nearest neighbors.
  *
  * An alternative approach to neighborhood preservation is through the
  * minimization of a cost function that measures differences between
  * distances in the input and output spaces. Important examples of such
  * techniques include classical multidimensional scaling (which is identical
  * to PCA), Isomap (which uses geodesic distances in the data space), diffusion
  * maps (which uses diffusion distances in the data space), t-SNE (which
  * minimizes the divergence between distributions over pairs of points),
  * and curvilinear component analysis.

  /** Isometric feature mapping. Isomap is a widely used low-dimensional embedding methods,
    * where geodesic distances on a weighted graph are incorporated with the
    * classical multidimensional scaling. Isomap is used for computing a
    * quasi-isometric, low-dimensional embedding of a set of high-dimensional
    * data points. Isomap is highly efficient and generally applicable to a broad
    * range of data sources and dimensionalities.
    *
    * To be specific, the classical MDS performs low-dimensional embedding based
    * on the pairwise distance between data points, which is generally measured
    * using straight-line Euclidean distance. Isomap is distinguished by
    * its use of the geodesic distance induced by a neighborhood graph
    * embedded in the classical scaling. This is done to incorporate manifold
    * structure in the resulting embedding. Isomap defines the geodesic distance
    * to be the sum of edge weights along the shortest path between two nodes.
    * The top n eigenvectors of the geodesic distance matrix, represent the
    * coordinates in the new n-dimensional Euclidean space.
    *
    * The connectivity of each data point in the neighborhood graph is defined
    * as its nearest k Euclidean neighbors in the high-dimensional space. This
    * step is vulnerable to "short-circuit errors" if k is too large with
    * respect to the manifold structure or if noise in the data moves the
    * points slightly off the manifold. Even a single short-circuit error
    * can alter many entries in the geodesic distance matrix, which in turn
    * can lead to a drastically different (and incorrect) low-dimensional
    * embedding. Conversely, if k is too small, the neighborhood graph may
    * become too sparse to approximate geodesic paths accurately.
    *
    * This class implements C-Isomap that involves magnifying the regions
    * of high density and shrink the regions of low density of data points
    * in the manifold. Edge weights that are maximized in Multi-Dimensional
    * Scaling(MDS) are modified, with everything else remaining unaffected.

    * Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection.

    * UMAP is a dimension reduction technique that can be used for visualization

    * The algorithm is founded on three assumptions about the data:
    *
    *  - The data is uniformly distributed on a Riemannian manifold;
    *  - The Riemannian metric is locally constant (or can be approximated as such);
    *  - The manifold is locally connected.
    *
    * From these assumptions it is possible to model the manifold with a fuzzy

    *                           being preserved. Generally in the range 2 to 100.

    * projection, while two points far apart in the high dimensional space should
    * appear far apart in the projection. The Sammon's mapping is a special case of

    *
    * Ideally when we project from a high dimensional space to a low dimensional
    * space the image would be geometrically congruent to the original figure.
    * This is called an isometric projection. Unfortunately it is rarely possible
    * to isometrically project objects down into lower dimensional spaces. Instead of
    * trying to achieve equality between corresponding inter-point distances we
    * can minimize the difference between corresponding inter-point distances.
    * This is one goal of the Sammon's mapping algorithm. A second goal of the Sammon's
    * mapping algorithm is to preserve the topology as best as possible by giving
