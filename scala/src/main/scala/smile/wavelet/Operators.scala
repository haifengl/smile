  /** Returns the wavelet filter. The filter name is derived from one of four classes of wavelet transform filters:
    * Daubechies, Least Asymetric, Best Localized and Coiflet. The prefixes for filters of these classes are
    * d, la, bl and c, respectively. Following the prefix, the filter name consists of an integer indicating length.
    * Supported lengths are as follows:
    *
    * '''Daubechies''' 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20.
    *
    * '''Least Asymetric''' 8,10,12,14,16,18,20.
    *
    * '''Best Localized''' 14,18,20.
    *
    * '''Coiflet''' 6,12,18,24,30.
    *
    * Additionally "haar" is supported for Haar wavelet. Although Haar wavelet is a special case of
    * the Daubechies wavelet transform filter of length 2, the implementation of "haar" is different from "d2".
    *
    * Besides, "d4", the simplest and most localized wavelet, uses a different centering method
    * from other Daubechies wavelet.

  /** The wavelet shrinkage is a signal denoising technique based on the idea of
    * thresholding the wavelet coefficients. Wavelet coefficients having small
    * absolute value are considered to encode mostly noise and very fine details
    * of the signal. In contrast, the important information is encoded by the
    * coefficients having large absolute value. Removing the small absolute value
    * coefficients and then reconstructing the signal should produce signal with
    * lesser amount of noise. The wavelet shrinkage approach can be summarized as
    * follows:
    *
    *  - Apply the wavelet transform to the signal.
    *  - Estimate a threshold value.
    *  - The so-called hard thresholding method zeros the coefficients that are
    *    smaller than the threshold and leaves the other ones unchanged. In contrast,
    *    the soft thresholding scales the remaining coefficients in order to form a
    *    continuous distribution of the coefficients centered on zero.
    *  - Reconstruct the signal (apply the inverse wavelet transform).
    *
    * The biggest challenge in the wavelet shrinkage approach is finding an
    * appropriate threshold value. In this method, we use the universal threshold
    * T = &sigma; sqrt(2*log(N)), where N is the length of time series
    * and &sigma; is the estimate of standard deviation of the noise by the
    * so-called scaled median absolute deviation (MAD) computed from the high-pass
    * wavelet coefficients of the first level of the transform.
    *
    * @param t the time series array. The size should be a power of 2. For time
    *          series of size no power of 2, 0 padding can be applied.
    * @param filter the wavelet filter to transform the time series.
    * @param soft true if apply soft thresholding.
