    <h2 class="question" id="link-with-smile">Link with Smile</h2>
    <p class="answer">
        Smile artifacts are hosted in <a href="https://oss.sonatype.org/#nexus-search;quick~smile-core">Sonatype Nexus</a>.
        You can add the following dependency into your pom.xml:</p>

    <pre><code>
    &lt;dependency&gt;
      &lt;groupId&gt;com.github.haifengl&lt;/groupId&gt;
      &lt;artifactId&gt;smile-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
      &lt;version&gt;1.5.0&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <p>If you're using SBT, add the following line into your build file:</p>

    <pre><code>
    libraryDependencies += "com.github.haifengl" % "smile-core" % "1.5.0"
    </code></pre>

    <p>For Scala API,</p>

    <pre><code>
    libraryDependencies += "com.github.haifengl" %% "smile-scala" % "1.5.0"
    </code></pre>

    <p>To enable machine optimised matrix computation, the users should add
        the dependency of smile-netlib:</p>
    <pre><code>
    &lt;dependency&gt;
      &lt;groupId&gt;com.github.haifengl&lt;/groupId&gt;
      &lt;artifactId&gt;smile-netlib&lt;/artifactId&gt;
      &lt;version&gt;1.5.0&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>and also make their machine-optimised libblas3 (CBLAS) and liblapack3 (Fortran)
        available as shared libraries at runtime. This module employs the highly efficient
        <a href="https://github.com/fommil/netlib-java#netlib-java">netlib-java</a>
        library.</p>

    <h3>OS X</h3>
    <p>Apple OS X requires no further setup as it ships with the veclib framework.</p>

    <h3>Linux</h3>
    <p>Generically-tuned ATLAS and OpenBLAS are available with most distributions
        and must be enabled explicitly using the package-manager. For example,</p>

    <pre><code>
    sudo apt-get install libatlas3-base libopenblas-base
    sudo update-alternatives --config libblas.so
    sudo update-alternatives --config libblas.so.3
    sudo update-alternatives --config liblapack.so
    sudo update-alternatives --config liblapack.so.3
    </code></pre>

    <p>However, these are only generic pre-tuned builds. If you have an Intel MKL licence,
    you could also create symbolic links from libblas.so.3 and liblapack.so.3 to libmkl_rt.so
    or use Debian's alternatives system.</p>

    <h3>Windows</h3>
    <p>The native_system builds expect to find libblas3.dll and liblapack3.dll
        on the %PATH% (or current working directory). Besides vendor-supplied
        implementations, OpenBLAS provide generically tuned binaries, and it
        is possible to build ATLAS.</p>

    <h2 class="question" id="model-serialization">Model serialization</h2>
    <p class="answer">To serialize a model, you may use</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    write(model, file)
    </code></pre>
    <p>This method is in the Scala API <code>smile.write</code> object and serialize the model to Java
    serialization format. This is handy if you want to use a model in Spark.</p>

    <p>Alternatively, you can also use</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    write.xstream(model, file)
    </code></pre>

    <p>which uses XStream library to serialize the model (actually any objects) to XML file.</p>

    <p>To read the model back, you can use <code>read(file)</code> or <code>read.xstream(file)</code>, correspondingly.</p>

    <h2 class="question" id="data-format">Data Format</h2>
    <p class="answer">
        Most Smile algorithms take simple <code>double[]</code> as input. So you can use your favorite methods
        or library to import the data as long as the samples are in double arrays. Meanwhile, Smile provides
        a couple of parsers for popular data formats, such as Weka's ARFF files, LibSVM's file format,
        delimited text files, and binary sparse data. These classes are in the package <code>smile.data.parser</code>
        and <code>smile.io</code> provides high level operators on top of these parsers. The package
        <code>smile.data.parser.microarray</code> also provides several parsers for microarray gene expression datasets,
        including GCT, PCL, RES, and TXT files.</p>

    <h2 class="question" id="pom">Cannot build Smile with maven</h2>
    <p class="answer">
        We have moved to SBT to build packages. The maven pom.xml files were deprecated and were removed in v1.2.0.
    </p>

    <h2 class="question" id="sbt-pgp">sbt error "not found: value useGpg"</h2>
    <p class="answer">
        Smile uses <a href="http://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-pgp/">sbt-pgp</a> plugin when
        publishing to maven central repository. Although you will not publish the project,
        you still have to set up sbt-pgp in order to build the packages. Fortunately, it is
        very easy. Simply add the following to your <code>~/.sbt/0.13/plugins/gpg.sbt</code> file:
    </p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    addSbtPlugin("com.jsuereth" % "sbt-pgp" % "1.0.0")
    </code></pre>

    <h2 class="question" id="headless-plot">Headless Plot</h2>
    <p class="answer">
        In case that your environment does not have a display or you need to generate and save
        a lot of plots without showing them on the screen, you may run Smile in headless model.
    </p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-bash"><code>
    bin/smile -Djava.awt.headless=true
    </code></pre>

    <p>The following example shows how to save a plot in the headless mode.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    val toy = read.table("data/classification/toy/toy-train.txt",response = Some((new NominalAttribute("class"), 0)))
    val (x, y) = toy.unzipInt

    val canvas = ScatterPlot.plot(x, y, '*', Array(Color.RED, Color.BLUE))

    val headless = new Headless(canvas);
    headless.pack();
    headless.setVisible(true);

    canvas.save(new java.io.File("headless.png"))
    </code></pre>

    <h2 class="question" id="seed">How can I set the random number generator seed for random forest?</h2>
    <p class="answer">
        This is a common question for stochastic algorithms like random forest.
        In general, this is discouraged because people often choose bad seed due to the lack
        of sufficient knowledge of random number generation. However, one may want the repeatable
        result for testing purpose. In this case, the short answer is that set
        <code>-Dsmile.threads=1</code> for JVM and call <code>smile.math.Math.setSeed</code> before
        training the model. Again, if you just want repeatable result, the first step should be sufficient.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that we don't provide a method to set the seed for a particular algorithm.
        Many algorithms are multithreaded and each thread has their own random number
        generator. We choose this design because each random number generator maintains
        an internal state so that it is not multithread-safe. If multithreads share a
        random number generator, we have to use locks, which significant reduce the
        performance.
    </p>

    <p>
        A method <code>setSeed(double)</code> in the algorithm is also troublesome.
        For algorithms like random forest, it is not right to initialize every thread
        with the same seed. Otherwise, same decision trees will be created
        and we lose the randomness of "random" forest. It is also complicated
        to pass a sequence of random numbers because it is not clear
        how many random number generators are needed for many algorithms. Even worse, it breaks
        the encapsulation as the caller has to know the details of algorithms.
