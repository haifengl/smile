    <h1 id="manifold-top" class="title">Manifold Learning</h1>

    <p>Manifold learning finds a low-dimensional basis for describing
        high-dimensional data. Manifold learning is a popular approach to nonlinear
        dimensionality reduction. Algorithms for this task are based on the idea
        that the dimensionality of many data sets is only artificially high; though
        each data point consists of perhaps thousands of features, it may be
        described as a function of only a few underlying parameters. That is, the
        data points are actually samples from a low-dimensional manifold that is
        embedded in a high-dimensional space. Manifold learning algorithms attempt
        to uncover these parameters in order to find a low-dimensional representation
        of the data.</p>

    <p>Some prominent approaches are locally linear embedding
        (LLE), Hessian LLE, Laplacian eigenmaps, and LTSA. These techniques
        construct a low-dimensional data representation using a cost function
        that retains local properties of the data, and can be viewed as defining
        a graph-based kernel for Kernel PCA. More recently, techniques have been
        proposed that, instead of defining a fixed kernel, try to learn the kernel
        using semidefinite programming. The most prominent example of such a
        technique is maximum variance unfolding (MVU). The central idea of MVU
        is to exactly preserve all pairwise distances between nearest neighbors
        (in the inner product space), while maximizing the distances between points
        that are not nearest neighbors.</p>

    <p>An alternative approach to neighborhood preservation is through the
        minimization of a cost function that measures differences between
        distances in the input and output spaces. Important examples of such
        techniques include classical multidimensional scaling (which is identical
        to PCA), Isomap (which uses geodesic distances in the data space), diffusion
        maps (which uses diffusion distances in the data space), t-SNE (which
        minimizes the divergence between distributions over pairs of points),
        and curvilinear component analysis.</p>

    <h2 id="isomap">Isomap</h2>

    <p>Isometric feature mapping (isomap) is a widely used low-dimensional embedding methods,
        where geodesic distances on a weighted graph are incorporated with the
        classical multidimensional scaling. Isomap is used for computing a
        quasi-isometric, low-dimensional embedding of a set of high-dimensional
        data points. Isomap is highly efficient and generally applicable to a broad
        range of data sources and dimensionalities.</p>

    <p>To be specific, the classical MDS performs low-dimensional embedding based
        on the pairwise distance between data points, which is generally measured
        using straight-line Euclidean distance. Isomap is distinguished by
        its use of the geodesic distance induced by a neighborhood graph
        embedded in the classical scaling. This is done to incorporate manifold
        structure in the resulting embedding. Isomap defines the geodesic distance
        to be the sum of edge weights along the shortest path between two nodes.
        The top <code>n</code> eigenvectors of the geodesic distance matrix, represent the
        coordinates in the new <code>n</code>-dimensional Euclidean space.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    def isomap(data: Array[Array[Double]], d: Int, k: Int, CIsomap: Boolean = true): IsoMap
    </code></pre>

    <p>The connectivity of each data point in the neighborhood graph is defined
        as its nearest <code>k</code> Euclidean neighbors in the high-dimensional space. This
        step is vulnerable to "short-circuit errors" if <code>k</code> is too large with
        respect to the manifold structure or if noise in the data moves the
        points slightly off the manifold. Even a single short-circuit error
        can alter many entries in the geodesic distance matrix, which in turn
        can lead to a drastically different (and incorrect) low-dimensional
        embedding. Conversely, if <code>k</code> is too small, the neighborhood graph may
        become too sparse to approximate geodesic paths accurately.</p>

    <p>When the optional parameter <code>CIsomap</code> is true, the method
        performs C-Isomap that involves magnifying the regions
        of high density and shrink the regions of low density of data points
        in the manifold. Edge weights that are maximized in Multi-Dimensional
        Scaling(MDS) are modified, with everything else remaining unaffected.</p>

        <div class="caption" style="min-width: 480px;">Swiss Roll</div>
    </div>

    <p>In the below example, we apply Isomap to the famous
        <a href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~dinoj/manifold/swissroll.html">swiss roll data</a> as shown above.
        This data set was created to test out various dimensionality reduction algorithms.
        The idea was to create several points in 2d, and then map them to 3d with some smooth
        function, and then to see what the algorithm would find when it mapped the points back to 2d.
        The data contains 20,000 samples. Because it is computational intensive to calculate
        the shortest path for all samples, the example uses only the first 2,000 samples.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    val swissroll = read.table("data/manifold/swissroll.txt").unzip
    plot(swissroll, '.', Color.BLUE)

    val map = isomap(swissroll.slice(0, 2000), 2, 7)

    val x = map.getCoordinates
    val window = plot(x, '.', Color.BLUE)

    val graph = map.getNearestNeighborGraph
    for (i <- 0 until x.length)
      for (j <- 0 until i)
        if (graph.hasEdge(i, j))
          window.canvas.line(x(i), x(j))
    </code></pre>

    <p>In this example, we use <code>k = 7</code> for neighborhood graph. In the mapped
        2d space, we also plot the connections between neighbor neighbors.</p>

    <div style="width: 100%; display: inline-block; text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/isomap.png" class="enlarge" style="width: 480px;" />
        <div class="caption" style="min-width: 480px;">Isomap</div>
    </div>

    <p>Note that Isomap produces strange holes like in a slice of Swiss cheese :).
        This issue can be solved by adding to Isomap a vector quantization step.</p>

    <h2 id="lle">LLE</h2>

    <p>Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) has several advantages over Isomap, including
        faster optimization when implemented to take advantage of sparse matrix
        algorithms, and better results with many problems. LLE also begins by
        finding a set of the nearest neighbors of each point. It then computes
        a set of weights for each point that best describe the point as a linear
        combination of its neighbors. Finally, it uses an eigenvector-based
        optimization technique to find the low-dimensional embedding of points,
        such that each point is still described with the same linear combination
        of its neighbors. LLE tends to handle non-uniform sample densities poorly
        because there is no fixed unit to prevent the weights from drifting as
        various regions differ in sample densities.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    def lle(data: Array[Array[Double]], d: Int, k: Int): LLE
    </code></pre>

    <p>The LLE using 8 neighbors on the swiss roll data is as follows.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    val map = lle(swissroll.slice(0, 2000), 2, 8)
    </code></pre>

    <div style="width: 100%; display: inline-block; text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/lle.png" class="enlarge" style="width: 480px;" />
        <div class="caption" style="min-width: 480px;">LLE</div>
    </div>

    <h2 id="laplacian">Laplacian Eigenmap</h2>

    <p>Using the notion of the Laplacian of the nearest
        neighbor adjacency graph, Laplacian Eigenmap computes a low dimensional
        representation of the dataset that optimally preserves local neighborhood
        information in a certain sense. The representation map generated by the
        algorithm may be viewed as a discrete approximation to a continuous map
        that naturally arises from the geometry of the manifold.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    def laplacian(data: Array[Array[Double]], d: Int, k: Int, t: Double = -1): LaplacianEigenmap
    </code></pre>

    <p>where <code>t</code> is the smooth/width parameter of heat kernel
        <code>e<sup>-||x-y||<sup>2</sup>/t</sup></code>.
        Non-positive <code>t</code> means discrete weights.</p>

    <p>The locality preserving character of the Laplacian Eigenmap algorithm makes
        it relatively insensitive to outliers and noise. It is also not prone to
        "short circuiting" as only the local distances are used.</p>

    <p>The Laplacian Eigenmap on the swiss roll data is as follows.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    val map = laplacian(swissroll.slice(0, 1000), 2, 10, 25.0)
    </code></pre>

    <div style="width: 100%; display: inline-block; text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/laplacian.png" class="enlarge" style="width: 480px;" />
        <div class="caption" style="min-width: 480px;">Laplacian Eigenmap</div>
    </div>

    <h2 id="t-sne">t-SNE</h2>

    <p>The t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) is a nonlinear
        dimensionality reduction technique that is particularly well suited
        for embedding high-dimensional data into a space of two or three
        dimensions, which can then be visualized in a scatter plot. Specifically,
        it models each high-dimensional object by a two- or three-dimensional
        point in such a way that similar objects are modeled by nearby points
        and dissimilar objects are modeled by distant points.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    def tsne(X: Array[Array[Double]], d: Int = 2, perplexity: Double = 20.0, eta: Double = 500.0, iterations: Int = 1000): TSNE
    </code></pre>

    <p>where <code>X</code> is input data, <code>perplexity</code> is the perplexity
        of the conditional distribution, <code>eta</code> the learning rate, and <code>iterations</code> is
        the number of iterations. If <code>X</code> is a square matrix, it is assumed
        to be the distance/dissimilarity matrix.</p>

    <p>The t-SNE on the MNIST data is as follows. Note that the input data is preprocessed
        using PCA to reduce the dimensionality to 50 before t-SNE is performed.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    val mnist = read.table("data/mnist/mnist2500_X.txt")
    val label = read.table("data/mnist/mnist2500_labels.txt")
    val x = mnist.unzip
    val y = label.unzip.map(_(0).toInt)
    val legend = label.unzip.map(_(0).toString)
    val pc = pca(x)
    pc.setProjection(50)
    val x50 = pc.project(x)
    val sne = tsne(x50, 3, 20, 200, 1000)
    plot(sne.getCoordinates, y, 'o', Palette.COLORS)
    </code></pre>
