    <h1 id="missing-value-imputation-top" class="title">Missing Value Imputation</h1>

    <p>So far, we have been living in a prefect data world where we select features,
        build models, and validate them. However, missing data, or missing values,
        are a common occurrence in real world and can have a
        significant effect on the conclusions that can be drawn from the data.</p>

    <p>Data are missing for many reasons. Missing data can occur because of
        nonresponse: no information is provided for several items or no information
        is provided for a whole unit. Some items are more sensitive for nonresponse
        than others, for example items about private subjects such as income.</p>

    <p>Dropout is a type of missingness that occurs mostly when studying
        development over time. In this type of study the measurement is repeated
        after a certain period of time. Missingness occurs when participants drop
        out before the test ends and one or more measurements are missing.</p>

    <p>Sometimes missing values are caused by the device failure or even by
        researchers themselves. It is important to question why the data is missing,
        this can help with finding a solution to the problem. If the values are
        missing at random there is still information about each variable in each
        unit but if the values are missing systematically the problem is more severe
        because the sample cannot be representative of the population.</p>

    <p>All of the causes for missing data fit into four classes, which are based
        on the relationship between the missing data mechanism and the missing and
        observed values. These classes are important to understand because the
        problems caused by missing data and the solutions to these problems are
        different for the four classes.</p>

    <p>The first is Missing Completely at Random (MCAR). MCAR means that the
        missing data mechanism is unrelated to the values of any variables, whether
        missing or observed. Data that are missing because a researcher dropped the
        test tubes or survey participants accidentally skipped questions are
        likely to be MCAR. If the observed values are essentially a random sample
        of the full data set, complete case analysis gives the same results as
        the full data set would have. Unfortunately, most missing data are not MCAR.</p>

    <p>At the opposite end of the spectrum is Non-Ignorable (NI). NI means that
        the missing data mechanism is related to the missing values. It commonly
        occurs when people do not want to reveal something very personal or
        unpopular about themselves. For example, if individuals with higher incomes
        are less likely to reveal them on a survey than are individuals with lower
        incomes, the missing data mechanism for income is non-ignorable. Whether
        income is missing or observed is related to its value. Complete case
        analysis can give highly biased results for NI missing data. If
        proportionally more low and moderate income individuals are left in
        the sample because high income people are missing, an estimate of the
        mean income will be lower than the actual population mean.</p>

    <p>In between these two extremes are Missing at Random (MAR) and Covariate
        Dependent (CD). Both of these classes require that the cause of the missing
        data is unrelated to the missing values, but may be related to the observed
        values of other variables. MAR means that the missing values are related to
        either observed covariates or response variables, whereas CD means that the
        missing values are related only to covariates. As an example of CD missing
        data, missing income data may be unrelated to the actual income values, but
        are related to education. Perhaps people with more education are less likely
        to reveal their income than those with less education.</p>

    <p>A key distinction is whether the mechanism is ignorable (i.e., MCAR, CD, or
        MAR) or non-ignorable. There are excellent techniques for handling ignorable
        missing data. Non-ignorable missing data are more challenging and require a
        different approach.</p>

    <p>If it is known that the data analysis technique which is to be used isn't
        content robust, it is good to consider imputing the missing data.
        Once all missing values have been imputed, the dataset can then be analyzed
        using standard techniques for complete data. The analysis should ideally
        take into account that there is a greater degree of uncertainty than if
        the imputed values had actually been observed, however, and this generally
        requires some modification of the standard complete-data analysis methods.
        Many imputation techniques are available.</p>

    <p>Imputation is not the only method available for handling missing data.
        The expectation-maximization algorithm is a method for finding maximum
        likelihood estimates that has been widely applied to missing data problems.
        In machine learning, it is sometimes possible to train a classifier directly
        over the original data without imputing it first. That was shown to yield
        better performance in cases where the missing data is structurally absent,
        rather than missing due to measurement noise.</p>

    <p>Smile provides several methods to impute missing values. The <code>NaN</code> values
        in the input data matrix are treated as missing values and will be replaced with imputed
        values after the processing.</p>

    <h2 id="average">Average Value Imputation</h2>

    <p>In this approach, we impute missing values with the average of other attributes in the instance.
        Assume the attributes of the dataset are of same kind, e.g. microarray gene
        expression data, the missing values can be estimated as the average of
        non-missing attributes in the same instance. Note that this is not the
        average of same attribute across different instances.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    def avgimpute(data: Array[Array[Double]]): Unit
    </code></pre>

    <h2 id="knn">K-Nearest Neighbor Imputation</h2>

    <p>The KNN-based method selects instances similar to the instance of interest to impute
        missing values. If we consider instance <code>A</code> that has one missing value on
        attribute <code>i</code>, this method would find <code>k</code> other instances, which have a value
        present on attribute <code>i</code> with values most similar (in term of some distance,
        e.g. Euclidean distance) to <code>A</code> on other attributes without missing values.
        The average of values on attribute <code>i</code> from the <code>k</code> nearest
        neighbors is then used as an estimate for the missing value in instance <code>A</code>.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    def knnimpute(data: Array[Array[Double]], k: Int = 5)
    </code></pre>

    <h2 id="kmeans">K-Means Imputation</h2>

    <p>This method first cluster data by K-Means
     with missing values and then impute missing values with the average value of each attribute
     in the clusters.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    def impute(data: Array[Array[Double]], k: Int, runs: Int = 1): Unit
    </code></pre>

    <h2 id="lls">Local Least Squares Imputation</h2>

    <p>The local least squares imputation method represents a target instance that has missing values as
        a linear combination of similar instances, which are selected by k-nearest
        neighbors method.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    def llsimpute(data: Array[Array[Double]], k: Int): Unit
    </code></pre>

    <h2 id="svd">SVD Imputation</h2>

    <p>Given SVD <code>A = U &Sigma; V<sup>T</sup></code>, we use the most significant eigenvectors of
        <code>V<sup>T</sup></code> to linearly estimate missing values. Although it has been
        shown that several significant eigenvectors are sufficient to describe
        the data with small errors, the exact fraction of eigenvectors best for
        estimation needs to be determined empirically. Once <code>k</code> most significant
        eigenvectors from <code>V<sup>T</sup></code> are selected, we estimate a missing value <code>j</code>
        in row <code>i</code> by first regressing this row against the <code>k</code> eigenvectors and then use
        the coefficients of the regression to reconstruct <code>j</code> from a linear combination
        of the <code>k</code> eigenvectors. The <code>j</code> th value of row <code>i</code> and the <code>j</code> th values of the <code>k</code>
        eigenvectors are not used in determining these regression coefficients.
        It should be noted that SVD can only be performed on complete matrices;
        therefore we originally fill all missing values by other methods (e.g. K-Means) in
        matrix <code>A</code>, obtaining <code>A'</code>. We then utilize an expectation maximization method to
        arrive at the final estimate, as follows. Each missing value in <code>A</code> is estimated
        using the above algorithm, and then the procedure is repeated on the newly
        obtained matrix, until the total change in the matrix falls below the
        empirically determined threshold (say 0.01).</p>
