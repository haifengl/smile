    <p>Different from classification, the output variable takes continuous values in regression analysis.
        Smile's regression algorithms are in the package
        <a href="api/java/smile/regression/package-summary.html"><code>smile.regression</code></a>
        and all algorithms implement the interface
        <a href="api/java/smile/regression/Regression.html"><code>Regression</code></a>
        that has a single method <code>predict</code> to apply the model
        to an instance. For all algorithms, the model can be trained through
        the constructor. Meanwhile, each algorithm has a <code>Trainer</code> companion
        class that can hold model hyper-parameters and be applied to multiple training
        datasets.</p>

    <p>The high-level operators are defined in Scala trait
        <a href="api/scala/index.html#smile.regression.Operators"><code>smile.regression.Operators</code></a>
        and also in the package object of <a href="api/scala/index.html#smile.regression.package"><code>smile.regression</code></a>.
        In what follows, we will discuss each algorithm, their high-level
        Scala API, and examples.</p>

    <h2 id="ols">Ordinary Least Squares</h2>

    <p>In linear regression, the model specification is that the dependent variable is a linear
        combination of the parameters. The residual is the difference between the value of the
        dependent variable predicted by the model, and the true value of the
        dependent variable. Ordinary least squares obtains parameter estimates
        that minimize the sum of squared residuals, SSE (also denoted RSS).</p>
        
    <p>The ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator is consistent when the independent variables are
        exogenous and there is no multicollinearity, and optimal in the class
        of linear unbiased estimators when the errors are homoscedastic and
        serially uncorrelated. Under these conditions, the method of OLS provides
        minimum-variance mean-unbiased estimation when the errors have finite
        variances.</p>
        
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    def ols(x: Array[Array[Double]], y: Array[Double]): OLS
    </code></pre>

    <p>where the parameter <code>x</code> is a matrix containing the explanatory variables,
        and <code>y</code> is the response values.</p>

    <p>There are several different frameworks in which the linear regression
        model can be cast in order to make the OLS technique applicable. Each
        of these settings produces the same formulas and same results, the only
        difference is the interpretation and the assumptions which have to be
        imposed in order for the method to give meaningful results. The choice
        of the applicable framework depends mostly on the nature of data at hand,
        and on the inference task which has to be performed.</p>
        
    <p>Least squares corresponds to the maximum likelihood criterion if the
        experimental errors have a normal distribution and can also be derived
        as a method of moments estimator.</p>
        
    <p>In what follows, we apply the ordinary least squares to an artificial
        data set by Breiman. The predictor
        attributes are generated independently using the following probabilities:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    P(X<sub>1</sub> = -1) = P(X<sub>1</sub> = 1) = 1/2

    P(X<sub>m</sub> = -1) = P(X<sub>m</sub> = 0) = P(X<sub>m</sub> = 1) = 1/3, m = 2,...,10
    </code></pre>

    <p>The value of the response variable <code>Y</code> is:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    Y =  3 + 3X<sub>2</sub> + 2X<sub>3</sub> + X<sub>4</sub> + &sigma;(0,1)  if X_1 =  1

    Y = -3 + 3X<sub>5</sub> + 2X<sub>6</sub> + X<sub>7</sub> + &sigma;(0,1)  if X_1 = -1
    </code></pre>

    <p>It is straightforward to fit an OLS model.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    val planes = read.arff("data/weka/regression/2dplanes.arff", 10)
    val (x, y) = planes.unzipDouble
    val model = ols(x, y)
    </code></pre>

    <p>We then can apply the regression model on a new data point.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    smile> model.predict(x(0))
    res1: Double = 5.073347387304475
    smile> y(0)
    res2: Double = 7.73906
    </code></pre>

    <p>Once a regression model has been constructed, it may be important to
        confirm the goodness of fit of the model and the statistical significance
        of the estimated parameters. Commonly used checks of goodness of fit
        include the R-squared, analysis of the pattern of residuals and hypothesis
        testing. Statistical significance can be checked by an F-test of the overall
        fit, followed by t-tests of individual parameters.</p>

    <p>Simply print out the model, we can inspect R-squared, the statistics and p-values of
        the t-test of parameter significance, and the F-test of goodness-of-fit.</p>

    <p>Interpretations of these diagnostic tests rest heavily on the model
        assumptions. Although examination of the residuals can be used to
        invalidate a model, the results of a t-test or F-test are sometimes more
        difficult to interpret if the model's assumptions are violated.
        For example, if the error term does not have a normal distribution,
        in small samples the estimated parameters will not follow normal
        distributions and complicate inference. With relatively large samples,
        however, a central limit theorem can be invoked such that hypothesis
        testing may proceed using asymptotic approximations.</p>

    <h2 id="ridge">Ridge Regression</h2>

    <p>Coefficient estimates for multiple linear regression models rely on
        the independence of the model terms. When terms are correlated and
        the columns of the design matrix X have an approximate linear dependence,
        the matrix <code>X'X</code> becomes close to singular. As a result, the least-squares estimate
        becomes highly sensitive to random errors in the observed response <code>Y</code>,
        producing a large variance.</p>

    <p>Ridge regression is one method to address these issues. In ridge regression,
        the matrix <code>X'X</code> is perturbed so as to make its determinant appreciably
        different from 0.</p>

    <p>Ridge regression is a kind of Tikhonov regularization, which is the most
        commonly used method of regularization of ill-posed problems.
        Ridge regression shrinks the regression coefficients by imposing a penalty
        on their size. By allowing a small amount of bias in the estimates, more
        reasonable coefficients may often be obtained. Often, small amounts of bias lead to
        dramatic reductions in the variance of the estimated model coefficients.</p>

    <p>Another interpretation of ridge regression is available through Bayesian estimation.
        In this setting the belief that weight should be small is coded into a prior
        distribution.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    def ridge(x: Array[Array[Double]], y: Array[Double], lambda: Double): RidgeRegression
    </code></pre>

    <p>where the parameter <code>x</code> is a matrix containing the explanatory variables,
        <code>y</code> is the response values, and <code>lambda</code> is
        the shrinkage/regularization parameter. Large <code>lambda</code> means more shrinkage.
        Choosing an appropriate value of <code>lambda</code> is important, and also difficult.</p>

    <p>Longley's macroeconomic regression data has 7 economical variables,
        observed yearly from 1947 to 1962. It is a well-known example for a highly
        collinear regression.</p>

    <p>When including an intercept term in the regression, we usually leave
        this coefficient unpenalized. Otherwise we could add some constant amount
        to the vector <code>y</code>, and this would not result in the same solution.
        If we center the columns of <code>X</code>, then the intercept estimate
        ends up just being the mean of <code>y</code>.</p>

    <p>The penalty term is unfair is the predictor variables are not on the
        same scale. Therefore, if we know that the variables are not measured
        in the same units, we typically scale the columns of X (to have sample
        variance 1), and then we perform ridge regression.</p>

    <p>It can be shown that ridge regression doesn’t set coefficients exactly to zero
        unless <code>&lambda; = &infin;</code>, in which case they’re all zero.
        Hence ridge regression cannot perform variable selection, and even though
        it performs well in terms of prediction accuracy, it does poorly in terms
        of offering a clear interpretation.</p>

    <h2 id="lasso">Lasso Regression</h2>

    <p>Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression
        is a shrinkage and selection method for linear regression.
        It minimizes the usual sum of squared errors, with a bound on the sum
        of the absolute values of the coefficients (i.e. L<sub>1</sub>-regularized).
        It has connections to soft-thresholding of wavelet coefficients, forward
        stage-wise regression, and boosting methods.</p>
        
    <p>The Lasso typically yields a sparse solution, of which the parameter
        vector &beta; has relatively few nonzero coefficients. In contrast, the
        solution of L<sub>2</sub>-regularized least squares (i.e. ridge regression)
        typically has all coefficients nonzero. Because it effectively
        reduces the number of variables, the Lasso is useful in some contexts.</p>

    <p>There is no analytic formula or expression for the optimal solution to the
        L<sub>1</sub>-regularized least squares problems. Therefore, its solution
        must be computed numerically. The objective function in the
        L<sub>1</sub>-regularized least squares is convex but not differentiable,
        so solving it is more of a computational challenge than solving the
        L<sub>2</sub>-regularized least squares. The Lasso may be solved using
        quadratic programming or more general convex optimization methods, as well
        as by specific algorithms such as the least angle regression algorithm.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    def lasso(x: Array[Array[Double]], y: Array[Double], lambda: Double, tol: Double = 1E-3, maxIter: Int = 5000): LASSO
    </code></pre>

    <p>where the parameter <code>x</code> is a matrix containing the explanatory variables,
        <code>y</code> is the response values,
        <code>lambda</code> is the shrinkage/regularization parameter,
        <code>tol</code> is the tolerance for stopping iterations (relative target duality gap),
        and <code>maxIter</code> is the maximum number of iterations.</p>

    <p>For over-determined systems (more instances than variables, commonly in
        machine learning), we normalize variables with mean 0 and standard deviation
        1. For under-determined systems (less instances than variables, e.g.
        compressed sensing), we assume white noise (i.e. no intercept in the linear
        model) and do not perform normalization. Note that the solution
        is not unique in this case.</p>

    <p>In what follows, we will apply Lasso to the diabetes data
        used in the "Least Angle Regression" paper. The basic data has 10 columns
        standardized to have unit L2 norm in each column and zero mean.
        The data used in the below example has 64 columns that consists of basic
        data plus certain interactions.</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    val diabetes = read.csv("data/regression/diabetes.csv", Some((new NumericAttribute("y"), 0)), header = true)
    val (x, y) = diabetes.unzipDouble

    println(lasso(x, y, 100))
    println(lasso(x, y, 500))

    <p>With large <code>lambda</code> values, we can observe that more and more
        parameters are regularized towards to 0.</p>

    <h2 id="rbf">Radial Basis Function Networks</h2>

    <p>A radial basis function network is an
        artificial neural network that uses radial basis functions as activation
        functions. It is a linear combination of radial basis functions. They are
        used in function approximation, time series prediction, and control.</p>

    <p>In its basic form, radial basis function network is in the form</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-html"><code>
    y(x) = &Sigma; w<sub>i</sub> &phi;(||x-c<sub>i</sub>||)
    </code></pre>

    <p>where the approximating function y(x) is represented as a sum of N radial
        basis functions &phi;, each associated with a different center c<sub>i</sub>,
        and weighted by an appropriate coefficient w<sub>i</sub>. For distance,
        one usually chooses Euclidean distance. The weights w<sub>i</sub> can
        be estimated using the matrix methods of linear least squares, because
        the approximating function is linear in the weights.</p>

    <p>RBF networks are typically trained by a two-step algorithm.
        In the first step, the center vectors <code>c<sub>i</sub></code>
        of the RBF functions in the hidden layer are chosen.
        This step can be performed in several ways; centers can be randomly
        sampled from some set of examples, or they can be determined
        using k-means clustering. Note that this step is unsupervised.</p>

    <p>The second step simply fits a linear model with coefficients <code>w<sub>i</sub></code> to
        the hidden layer's outputs with respect to some objective function.
        A common objective function, at least for regression/function estimation,
        is the least squares function.</p>

    <p>A optional third backpropagation step can be performed to fine-tune all of the RBF
        network's parameters.</p>

    <p>The popular choices for &phi; comprise the Gaussian function and the so
        called thin plate splines. The advantage of the thin plate splines is that
        their conditioning is invariant under scalings. Gaussian, multi-quadric
        and inverse multi-quadric are infinitely smooth and and involve a scale
        or shape parameter, r<sub><small>0</small></sub> &gt; 0. Decreasing
        r<sub><small>0</small></sub> tends to flatten the basis function. For a
        given function, the quality of approximation may strongly depend on this
        parameter. In particular, increasing r<sub><small>0</small></sub> has the
        effect of better conditioning (the separation distance of the scaled points
        increases).</p>

    <p>Note that we use the fully qualified name <code>smile.regression.rbfnet</code>
        in above example.
        The reason is that we import both <code>smile.regression._</code> and
        <code>smile.classification._</code> in the shell. And by Scala's scope rule,
        the later imported names shadow the same ones in earlier imported packages.
        If you work only on regression problems in a shell session, just import
        <code>smile.regression._</code> again to avoid using the fully qualified names.</p>

    <p>A variant on RBF networks is normalized radial basis function (NRBF)
        networks, in which we require the sum of the basis functions to be unity.
        NRBF arises more naturally from a Bayesian statistical perspective. However,
        there is no evidence that either the NRBF method is consistently superior
        to the RBF method, or vice versa.</p>

    <h2 id="svr">Support Vector Regression</h2>

    <p>Support vector machine can be used as a regression method, maintaining
        all the main features of the algorithm. In the case of regression, a margin
        of tolerance &epsilon; is set in approximation. The goal of SVR is to find
        a function that has at most &epsilon; deviation from the response variable
        for all the training data, and at the same time is as flat as possible.
        In other words, we do not care about errors as long as they are less than &epsilon;,
        but will not accept any deviation larger than this.</p>

    <p>Like SVM for classification, nonlinear SVR employs kernel trick for implict mapping.
        And the model produced by SVR depends only on a subset of the training data, because the cost
        function ignores any training data close to the model prediction (within
        the &epsilon; threshold).</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    def svr[T](x: Array[T], y: Array[Double], kernel: MercerKernel[T], eps: Double, C: Double, weight: Array[Double] = null, tol: Double = 1E-3): SVR[T]
    </code></pre>

    <p>where the parameter <code>x</code> is the training data,
        <code>y</code> is the response variable,
        <code>kernel</code> is the kernel function,
        <code>eps</code> is the loss function error threshold,
        <code>C</code> is the soft margin penalty parameter,
        <code>weight</code> is the optional positive instance weight so that the soft margin penalty
        parameter for instance <i>i</i> will be <code>weight(i) * C</code>,
        and <code>tol</code> the tolerance of convergence test.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>

        svr(x, y, new GaussianKernel(0.06), 20, 10)
    }
    </code></pre>

    <p>Applying SVR to the diabetes data, we observe a smaller RMSE by 10-fold cross validation
        compared to the RBF networks in previous section. Note that we have not optimized the hyperparameters in both cases.</p>

    <h2 id="tree">Regression Tree</h2>

    <p>Similar to decision trees, regression trees can be learned by
        splitting the training set into subsets based on an attribute value
        test. This process is repeated on each derived subset in a recursive
        manner called recursive partitioning. The recursion is completed when
        the subset at a node all has the same value of the target variable,
        or when splitting no longer adds value to the predictions.</p>
        
    <p>The algorithms that are used for constructing decision trees usually
        work top-down by choosing a variable at each step that is the next best
        variable to use in splitting the set of items. "Best" is defined by how
        well the variable splits the set into homogeneous subsets that have
        the same value of the target variable. Different algorithms use different
        formulae for measuring "best". Used by the CART algorithm, Gini impurity
        is a measure of how often a randomly chosen element from the set would
        be incorrectly labeled if it were randomly labeled according to the
        distribution of labels in the subset. Gini impurity can be computed by
        summing the probability of each item being chosen times the probability
        of a mistake in categorizing that item. It reaches its minimum (zero) when
        all cases in the node fall into a single target category. Information gain
        is another popular measure, used by the ID3, C4.5 and C5.0 algorithms.
        Information gain is based on the concept of entropy used in information
        theory. For categorical variables with different number of levels, however,
        information gain are biased in favor of those attributes with more levels.
        Instead, one may employ the information gain ratio, which solves the drawback
        of information gain.</p>

    <p>Classification and Regression Tree techniques have a number of advantages
        over many of those alternative techniques.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Simple to understand and interpret:</dt>
        <dd><p>In most cases, the interpretation of results summarized in a tree is
            very simple. This simplicity is useful not only for purposes of rapid
            classification of new observations, but can also often yield a much simpler
            "model" for explaining why observations are classified or predicted in a
            particular manner.</p></dd>

        <dt>Able to handle both numerical and categorical data:</dt>
        <dd><p>Other techniques are usually specialized in analyzing datasets that
            have only one type of variable.</p></dd>

        <dt>Nonparametric and nonlinear:</dt>
        <dd><p>The final results of using tree methods for classification or regression
            can be summarized in a series of (usually few) logical if-then conditions
            (tree nodes). Therefore, there is no implicit assumption that the underlying
            relationships between the predictor variables and the dependent variable
            are linear, follow some specific non-linear link function, or that they
            are even monotonic in nature. Thus, tree methods are particularly well
            suited for data mining tasks, where there is often little a priori
            knowledge nor any coherent set of theories or predictions regarding which
            variables are related and how. In those types of data analytics, tree
            methods can often reveal simple relationships between just a few variables
            that could have easily gone unnoticed using other analytic techniques.</p></dd>
    </dl>

    <p>One major problem with classification and regression trees is their high
        variance. Often a small change in the data can result in a very different
        series of splits, making interpretation somewhat precarious. Besides,
        decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that cause over-fitting.
        Mechanisms such as pruning are necessary to avoid this problem.
        Another limitation of trees is the lack of smoothness of the prediction
        surface.</p>
        
    <p>Some techniques such as bagging, boosting, and random forest use more than
        one decision tree for their analysis.</p>

    <h2 id="forest">Random Forest</h2>

    <p>Random forest is an ensemble classifier
        that consists of many decision trees and outputs the majority vote of
        individual trees. The method combines bagging idea and the random
        selection of features.</p>
        
    <p>Each tree is constructed using the following algorithm:</p>
        
    <ol>
        <li>If the number of cases in the training set is N, randomly sample N cases
        with replacement from the original data. This sample will
        be the training set for growing the tree.</li>

        <li> If there are M input variables, a number m &lt;&lt; M is specified such
        that at each node, m variables are selected at random out of the M and
        the best split on these m is used to split the node. The value of m is
        held constant during the forest growing.</li>

        <li>Each tree is grown to the largest extent possible. There is no pruning.</li>
    </ol>
        
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    def randomForest(x: Array[Array[Double]], y: Array[Double], attributes: Array[Attribute] = null, ntrees: Int = 500, maxNodes: Int = -1, nodeSize: Int = 5, mtry: Int = -1, subsample: Double = 1.0): RandomForest
    </code></pre>

    <p>where the parameter <code>x</code> is the training data,
        <code>y</code> is the response variable,
        <code>ntrees</code> is the number of trees,
        <code>nodeSize</code> is the number of instances in a node below which the tree will
        not split, setting nodeSize = 5 generally gives good results,
        and <code>maxNodes</code> is the maximum number of leaf nodes.
        The parameter <code>mtry</code> is the number of input variables to be used to determine the decision
        at a node of the tree. The default value p/3 seems to give generally good performance,
        where p is the number of variables.
        Besides, <code>subsample</code> is the sampling rate for training tree. The default value
        1.0 means sampling with replacement. Otherwise, the value &lt; 1.0 means
        sampling without replacement.
        The optional <code>attributes</code> is the attribute properties. If not provided, all attributes
        are treated as numeric values.</p>

    <p>Similar to <code>rbfnet</code>, we have to use the fully qualified name
        <code>smile.regression.randomForest</code> in the shell for regression.</p>

    <p>Applying to the diabetes data, we get RMSE 56.4 for 10-fold cross validation
        with 500 regression trees of 200 nodes, which significantly smaller than
        a single regression tree.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    cv(x, y, 10) { case (x, y) =>
        smile.regression.randomForest(x, y, maxNodes = 200)
    }
    </code></pre>

    <p>The advantages of random forest are:</p>
        
    <ul>
        <li>For many data sets, it produces a highly accurate classifier.</li>
        <li>It runs efficiently on large data sets.</li>
        <li>It can handle thousands of input variables without variable deletion.</li>
        <li>It gives estimates of what variables are important in the classification.</li>
        <li>It generates an internal unbiased estimate of the generalization error
        as the forest building progresses.</li>
        <li>It has an effective method for estimating missing data and maintains
        accuracy when a large proportion of the data are missing.</li>
    </ul>
        
    <p>The disadvantages are</p>
        
    <ul>
        <li>Random forests are prone to over-fitting for some datasets. This is
        even more pronounced on noisy data.</li>

        <li>For data including categorical variables with different number of
        levels, random forests are biased in favor of those attributes with more
        levels. Therefore, the variable importance scores from random forest are
        not reliable for this type of data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="gbm">Gradient Boosting</h2>

    <p>Gradient boosting is typically used
        with decision trees (especially CART regression trees) of a fixed size as
        base learners. For this special case Friedman proposes a modification to
        gradient boosting method which improves the quality of fit of each base
        learner.</p>
        
    <p>Generic gradient boosting at the <i>t</i>-th step would fit a regression tree to
        pseudo-residuals. Let J be the number of its leaves. The tree partitions
        the input space into J disjoint regions and predicts a constant value in
        each region. The parameter J controls the maximum allowed
        level of interaction between variables in the model. With J = 2 (decision
        stumps), no interaction between variables is allowed. With J = 3 the model
        may include effects of the interaction between up to two variables, and
        so on. Hastie et al. comment that typically 4 &le; J &le; 8 work well
        for boosting and results are fairly insensitive to the choice of in
        this range, J = 2 is insufficient for many applications, and J &gt; 10 is
        unlikely to be required.</p>
        
    <p>Fitting the training set too closely can lead to degradation of the model's
        generalization ability. Several so-called regularization techniques reduce
        this over-fitting effect by constraining the fitting procedure.
        One natural regularization parameter is the number of gradient boosting
        iterations T (i.e. the number of trees in the model when the base learner
        is a decision tree). Increasing T reduces the error on training set,
        but setting it too high may lead to over-fitting. An optimal value of T
        is often selected by monitoring prediction error on a separate validation
        data set.</p>
        
    <p>Another regularization approach is the shrinkage which times a parameter
        &eta; (called the "learning rate") to update term.
        Empirically it has been found that using small learning rates (such as
        &eta; &lt; 0.1) yields dramatic improvements in model's generalization ability
        over gradient boosting without shrinking (&eta; = 1). However, it comes at
        the price of increasing computational time both during training and
        prediction: lower learning rate requires more iterations.</p>
        
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    def gbm(x: Array[Array[Double]], y: Array[Double], attributes: Array[Attribute] = null, loss: GradientTreeBoost.Loss = GradientTreeBoost.Loss.LeastAbsoluteDeviation, ntrees: Int = 500, maxNodes: Int = 6, shrinkage: Double = 0.05, subsample: Double = 0.7): GradientTreeBoost
    </code></pre>

    <p>where the parameter <code>x</code> is the training data,
        <code>y</code> is the response variable,
        <code>ntrees</code> is the number of trees,
        and <code>maxNodes</code> is the maximum number of leaf nodes.
        The parameter <code>loss</code> is the loss function for regression. By default, least absolute
        deviation is employed for robust regression.
        The parameter <code>shrinkage</code> is the shrinkage parameter in (0, 1] controls the learning rate of procedure.
        Besides, <code>subsample</code> is the sampling rate for training tree. The default value
        1.0 means sampling with replacement. Otherwise, the value &lt; 1.0 means
        sampling without replacement.
        The optional <code>attributes</code> is the attribute properties. If not provided, all attributes
        are treated as numeric values.</p>

    <p>Similar to <code>rbfnet</code>, we have to use the fully qualified name
        <code>smile.regression.gbm</code> in the shell for regression.</p>

    <p>Applying to the diabetes data, we get RMSE 58.8 for 10-fold cross validation
        with 500 iterations. This is comparable to the result of random forest but
        uses only 6 nodes for each regression tree.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    cv(x, y, 10) { case (x, y) =>
        smile.regression.gbm(x, y)
    }
    </code></pre>

    <p>Soon after the introduction of gradient boosting Friedman proposed a
        minor modification to the algorithm, motivated by Breiman's bagging method.
        Specifically, he proposed that at each iteration of the algorithm, a base
        learner should be fit on a subsample of the training set drawn at random
        without replacement. Friedman observed a substantial improvement in
        gradient boosting's accuracy with this modification.</p>
        
    <p>Subsample size is some constant fraction f of the size of the training set.
        When f = 1, the algorithm is deterministic and identical to the one
        described above. Smaller values of f introduce randomness into the
        algorithm and help prevent over-fitting, acting as a kind of regularization.
        The algorithm also becomes faster, because regression trees have to be fit
        to smaller datasets at each iteration. Typically, f is set to 0.5, meaning
        that one half of the training set is used to build each base learner.</p>
        
    <p>Also, like in bagging, sub-sampling allows one to define an out-of-bag
        estimate of the prediction performance improvement by evaluating predictions
        on those observations which were not used in the building of the next
        base learner. Out-of-bag estimates help avoid the need for an independent
        validation dataset, but often underestimate actual performance improvement
        and the optimal number of iterations.</p>
        
    <p>Gradient tree boosting implementations often also use regularization by
        limiting the minimum number of observations in trees' terminal nodes.
        It's used in the tree building process by ignoring any splits that lead
        to nodes containing fewer than this number of training set instances.
        Imposing this limit helps to reduce variance in predictions at leaves.</p>

    <h2 id="gp">Gaussian Process</h2>

    <p>A Gaussian process is a stochastic process
        whose realizations consist of random values associated with every point in
        a range of times (or of space) such that each such random variable has
        a normal distribution. Moreover, every finite collection of those random
        variables has a multivariate normal distribution.</p>
        
    <p>A Gaussian process can be used as a prior probability distribution over
        functions in Bayesian inference. Given any set of N points in the desired
        domain of your functions, take a multivariate Gaussian whose covariance
        matrix parameter is the Gram matrix of N points with some desired kernel,
        and sample from that Gaussian. Inference of continuous values with a
        Gaussian process prior is known as Gaussian process regression.</p>
        
    <p>The fitting is performed in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space with
        the "kernel trick". The loss function is squared-error. This also arises
        as the kriging estimate of a Gaussian random field in spatial statistics.</p>

    <p>A significant problem with Gaussian process prediction is that it typically
        scales as O(n<sup>3</sup>). For large problems (e.g. n &gt; 10,000) both
        storing the Gram matrix and solving the associated linear systems are
        prohibitive on modern workstations. An extensive range of proposals have
        been suggested to deal with this problem. A popular approach is the
        reduced-rank Approximations of the Gram Matrix, known as Nystrom approximation.
        Greedy approximation is another popular approach that uses an active set of
        training points of size m selected from the training set of size n &gt; m.
        We assume that it is impossible to search for the optimal subset of size m
        due to combinatorics. The points in the active set could be selected
        randomly, but in general we might expect better performance if the points
        are selected greedily w.r.t. some criterion. Recently, researchers had
        proposed relaxing the constraint that the inducing variables must be a
        subset of training/test cases, turning the discrete selection problem
        into one of continuous optimization.</p>

    <p>This function fits a regular Gaussian process model.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    def gpr[T](x: Array[T], y: Array[Double], kernel: MercerKernel[T], lambda: Double): GaussianProcessRegression[T]
    </code></pre>

    <p>while the below function fit an approximate model</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    def gpr[T](x: Array[T], y: Array[Double], t: Array[T], kernel: MercerKernel[T], lambda: Double, nystrom: Boolean = false): GaussianProcessRegression[T]
    </code></pre>

    <p>where the parameter <code>x</code> is the training data,
        <code>y</code> is the response variable,
        <code>kernel</code> is the Mercer kernel function,
        and <code>lambda</code> is the shrinkage/regularization parameter.
        For approximation model, the parameter <code>t</code> is the inducing input,
        which are pre-selected or inducing samples
        acting as active set of regressors. In simple case, these can be chosen
        randomly from the training set or as the centers of k-means clustering.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    cv(x, y, 10) { case (x, y) =>
        val t = kmeans(x, 300).centroids
        gpr(x, y, t, new GaussianKernel(0.06), 0.01)
    }
    </code></pre>

    <p>In the above example, we train the approximate Gaussian Process models
        with inducing samples by k-means clustering. The hyperparameters are not
        optimized yet though.</p>
