    <h1 id="validation-top" class="title">Model Validation</h1>

    <p>When training a supervised model, we should always evaluate the goodness of fit of
        the model. This helps on model selection and also hyperparameter tuning.
        First of all, we should note that the error of the model as measured
        on the training data is likely to be lower than the actual generalization error.</p>

    <p>Although most supervised learning algorithms try to minimize the empirical error
        (regularized or not), we should not use only error rate or accuracy as the objective
        measure. For example, if a highly unbalanced data contains 99% positive sample, a naive
        algorithm that classifies everything as positive will have 99% accuracy. However,
        it is useless.</p>

    <p>For classification, Smile has the following measures:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The <b>accuracy</b> is the proportion of true results (both true positives and
            true negatives) in the population.</li>
        <li>The <b>sensitivity</b> or <b>true positive rate</b> (TPR) (also called <b>hit rate</b>, <b>recall</b>)
            is a statistical measures of the performance of a binary classification test.
            Sensitivity is the proportion of actual positives which are correctly identified as such.
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-html"><code>
    TPR = TP / P = TP / (TP + FN)
    </code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>The <b>specificity</b> (SPC) or <b>true negative rate</b> is a statistical measures of the performance
            of a binary classification test. Specificity measures the proportion
            of negatives which are correctly identified.
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-html"><code>
    SPC = TN / N = TN / (FP + TN) = 1 - FPR
    </code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>The <b>precision</b> or <b>positive predictive value</b> (PPV) is ratio of true positives
            to combined true and false positives, which is different from sensitivity.
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-html"><code>
    PPV = TP / (TP + FP)
    </code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>The <b>false discovery rate</b> (FDR) is ratio of false positives
            to combined true and false positives, which is actually 1 - precision.
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-html"><code>
    FDR = FP / (TP + FP)
    </code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><b>Fall-out, false alarm rate, or false positive rate</b> (FPR) is
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-html"><code>
    FPR = FP / N = FP / (FP + TN)
    </code></pre>
            Fall-out is actually Type I error and closely related to specificity (1 - specificity).</li>
        <li><p>The <b>F-score</b> (or <b>F-measure</b>) considers both the precision and the recall of the test
            to compute the score. The traditional or balanced F-score (F1 score) is the harmonic mean of
            precision and recall, where an F1 score reaches its best value at 1 and worst at 0.</p>

            <p>The general formula involves a positive real &beta; so that F-score measures
            the effectiveness of retrieval with respect to a user who attaches &beta; times
            as much importance to recall as precision.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>In Smile, the class label 1 is regarded as positive and all others are regarded as negative.</p>

    <p>Sensitivity and specificity are closely related to the concepts of type I and type II errors.
        For any test, there is usually a trade-off between the measures. This trade-off
        can be represented graphically using an ROC curve.</p>

    <p>For regression, Smile has the following measures:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>MSE (mean squared error) and RMSE (root mean squared error.).</li>
        <li>Absolute deviation error.</li>
        <li>RSS (residual sum of squares).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="out-of-sample">Out-of-sample Evaluation</h2>

    <p>The generalization error (also known as the out-of-sample error) is
        a measure of how accurately an algorithm is able to predict outcome
        values for previously unseen data. Ideally, test data should be
        statistically independent from training data.
        But in practice, we usually have only one historical dataset and
        the evaluation of a learning algorithm may be sensitive to sampling error.
        In what follows, we discuss various testing mechanisms.</p>

    <h3 id="hold-out">Hold-out Testing</h3>

    <p>Hold-out testing assume that all data
        samples are independently and identically distributed (this is also
        the basic assumption of most learning algorithms).
        A part of the data is hold out for testing. Many benchmark data
        contain a separate test dataset.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    // Test a generic classifier. Only accuracy is calculated.
    def test[T](x: Array[T], y: Array[Int], testx: Array[T], testy: Array[Int], parTest: Boolean = true)(trainer: => (Array[T], Array[Int]) => Classifier[T]): Classifier[T]

    // Test a binary classifier. Report accuracy, sensitivity/recall, specificity, precision, and F-Score.
    def test2[T](x: Array[T], y: Array[Int], testx: Array[T], testy: Array[Int], parTest: Boolean = true)(trainer: => (Array[T], Array[Int]) => Classifier[T]): Classifier[T]

    // Test a binary soft classifier. In addition to test2, AUC is caulcated.
    def test2soft[T](x: Array[T], y: Array[Int], testx: Array[T], testy: Array[Int], parTest: Boolean = true)(trainer: => (Array[T], Array[Int]) => SoftClassifier[T]): SoftClassifier[T]
    </code></pre>

    <p>The above methods takes a code block to train the model and apply it on the test data.
        If the parameter <code>parTest</code> is true, the testing is performed parallely
        on multi cores. For some implementations that is not multi-threading safe, e.g. neural
        networks, this parameter should be set false. These methods return the trained model
        and print out various measures.</p>

    <h3 id="out-of-bag">Out-of-bag Error</h3>

    <p>Out-of-bag (OOB) error, also called out-of-bag estimate, is a method of measuring
        the prediction error of random forests, boosted decision trees, and other machine
        learning models utilizing bootstrap aggregating to sub-sample data sampled used
        for training. OOB is the mean prediction error on each training sample <code>x<sub>i</sub></code>, using
        only the trees that did not have <code>x<sub>i</sub></code> in their bootstrap sample.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    val rf = randomForest(x, y)
    println(s"OOB error = ${rf.error}")
    </code></pre>

    <p>Subsampling allows one to define an out-of-bag estimate of the prediction performance
        improvement by evaluating predictions on those observations which were not used
        in the building of the next base learner. Out-of-bag estimates help avoid the
        need for an independent validation dataset, but often underestimate actual
        performance improvement and the optimal number of iterations.</p>

    <h2 id="cross-validation">Cross Validation</h2>

    <p>In <code>k</code>-fold cross validation, the dataset is divided into <code>k</code> random partitions.
        We treat each of the <code>k</code> partition like a hold-out set, train a model on
        the rest of data, and measure the quality of the model on the held-out.
        The overall performance is taken to be the average of the performance
        on all <code>k</code> partitions.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    def cv[T](x: Array[T], y: Array[Int], k: Int, measures: ClassificationMeasure*)(trainer: => (Array[T], Array[Int]) => Classifier[T]): Array[Double]

    def cv[T](x: Array[T], y: Array[Double], k: Int, measures: RegressionMeasure*)(trainer: => (Array[T], Array[Double]) => Regression[T]): Array[Double]
    </code></pre>

    <p>When no measures are provided, the methods use accuracy or RMSE by default
        for classification or regression, respectively.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    val data = readArff("data/weka/iris.arff", 4)
    val (x, y) = data.unzipInt
    cv(x, y, 10) { case (x, y) => lda(x, y) }
    </code></pre>

    <p>On the Iris data, the accuracy estimation of 10-fold cross validation
        is about 84%. You may get different number because of the random partitions.</p>

    <p>A special case is the leave-one-out cross validation that uses a single observation
        from the original sample as the validation data, and the remaining
        observations as the training data. This is repeated such that each
        observation in the sample is used once as the validation data.
        Leave-one-out cross-validation is
        usually very expensive from a computational point of view because of the
        large number of times the training process is repeated.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    def loocv[T](x: Array[T], y: Array[Int], measures: ClassificationMeasure*)(trainer: => (Array[T], Array[Int]) => Classifier[T]): Array[Double]

    def loocv[T](x: Array[T], y: Array[Double], measures: RegressionMeasure*)(trainer: => (Array[T], Array[Double]) => Regression[T]): Array[Double]
    </code></pre>

    <p>On the Iris data, the accuracy estimation of LOOCV is 85.33%,
        which is higher than that of 10-fold cross validation. This
        is because more data is used for training and less for testing.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    loocv(x, y) { case (x, y) => lda(x, y) }
    </code></pre>

    <h2 id="bootstrap">Bootstrap</h2>

    <p>Bootstrap is a general tool for assessing statistical accuracy. The basic
        idea is to randomly draw data with replacement from the training data,
        each bootstrap sample set has the same size as the original training set.
        In the bootstrap set, the expected ratio of unique instances is
        approximately <code>1 − 1/e ≈ 63.2%</code>. This process is done many
        times (say <code>k = 100</code>), producing <code>k</code> bootstrap datasets.
        Then we fit the model to each of the bootstrap datasets and examine
        the behavior of the fits over the <code>k</code> replications.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    def bootstrap[T](x: Array[T], y: Array[Int], k: Int, measures: ClassificationMeasure*)(trainer: => (Array[T], Array[Int]) => Classifier[T]): Array[Double]

    def bootstrap[T](x: Array[T], y: Array[Double], k: Int, measures: RegressionMeasure*)(trainer: => (Array[T], Array[Double]) => Regression[T]): Array[Double]
    </code></pre>

    <p>On the Iris data, the accuracy estimation of 100 bootstraps
        is about 83.3%, which is slightly lower than that of 10-fold cross validation.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    bootstrap(x, y, 100) { case (x, y) => lda(x, y) }
    </code></pre>

    <p>The bootstrap distribution of a parameter-estimator has been used to
        calculate confidence intervals for its population-parameter.
        If the bootstrap distribution of an estimator
        is symmetric, then percentile confidence-interval are often used;
        such intervals are appropriate especially for median-unbiased estimators
        of minimum risk (with respect to an absolute loss function).
        Otherwise, if the bootstrap distribution is non-symmetric, then percentile
        confidence-intervals are often inappropriate.</p>

    <p>The bootstrap distribution and the sample may disagree systematically,
        in which case bias may occur. Bias in the
        bootstrap distribution will lead to bias in the confidence-interval.</p>
