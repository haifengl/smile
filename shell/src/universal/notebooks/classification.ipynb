    "A decision tree can be learned by splitting the training set into subsets based on an attribute value test.

The recursion is completed when the subset at a node all has the same value of the target variable, or when splitting no longer adds value to the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithms that are used for constructing decision trees usually work top-down by choosing a variable at each step that is the next best variable to use in splitting the set of items. \"Best\" is defined by how well the variable splits the set into homogeneous subsets that have the same value of the target variable. Different algorithms use different formulae for measuring \"best\". Used by the CART (Classification and Regression Tree) algorithm, Gini impurity is a measure of how often a randomly chosen element from the set would be incorrectly labeled if it were randomly labeled according to the distribution of labels in the subset. Gini impurity can be computed by summing the probability of each item being chosen times the probability of a mistake in categorizing that item. It reaches its minimum (zero) when all cases in the node fall into a single target category. Information gain is another popular measure, used by the ID3, C4.5 and C5.0 algorithms. Information gain is based on the concept of entropy used in information theory. For categorical variables with different number of levels, however, information gain are biased in favor of those attributes with more levels. Instead, one may employ the information gain ratio, which solves the drawback of information gain.\n",

Therefore, there is no implicit assumption that the underlying relationships between the predictor variables and the dependent variable are linear, follow some specific non-linear link function, or that they are even monotonic in nature. Thus, tree methods are particularly well suited for data mining tasks, where there is often little a priori knowledge nor any coherent set of theories or predictions regarding which variables are related and how. In those types of data analytics, tree methods can often reveal simple relationships between just a few variables that could have easily gone unnoticed using other analytic techniques.\n",

Although the original random forest algorithm trains each tree fully without pruning, it is useful to control the tree size some times, which can be achieved by the parameter maxNodes. The tree can also be regularized by limiting the minimum number of observations in trees' terminal nodes with the parameter nodeSize. When subsample = 1.0, we use the sampling with replacement to train each tree as described above. If subsample < 1.0, we instead select a subset of samples (without replacement) to train each tree. If the classes are not balanced, the user should provide the classWeight (proportional to the class priori) so that the sampling is done in stratified way. Otherwise, small classes may be not sampled sufficiently."

    "## Gradient Boosted Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of gradient boosting originated in the observation that boosting can be interpreted as an optimization algorithm on a suitable cost function. In particular, the boosting algorithms can be abstracted as iterative functional gradient descent algorithms. That is, algorithms that optimize a cost function over function space by iteratively choosing a function (weak hypothesis) that points in the negative gradient direction Gradient boosting is typically used with CART regression trees of a fixed size as base learners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generic gradient boosting at the *t-th* step would fit a regression tree to pseudo-residuals. Let `J` be the number of its leaves. The tree partitions the input space into J disjoint regions and predicts a constant value in each region. The parameter `J` controls the maximum allowed level of interaction between variables in the model. With `J = 2` (decision stumps), no interaction between variables is allowed. With `J = 3` the model may include effects of the interaction between up to two variables, and so on. Hastie et al. comment that typically `4 ≤ J ≤ 8` work well for boosting and results are fairly insensitive to the choice of in this range, `J = 2` is insufficient for many applications, and `J > 10` is unlikely to be required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fitting the training set too closely can lead to degradation of the model's generalization ability. Several so-called regularization techniques reduce this over-fitting effect by constraining the fitting procedure. One natural regularization parameter is the number of gradient boosting iterations T (i.e. the number of trees in the model when the base learner is a decision tree). Increasing T reduces the error on training set, but setting it too high may lead to over-fitting. An optimal value of T is often selected by monitoring prediction error on a separate validation data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another regularization approach is the shrinkage which times a parameter `η` (called the \"learning rate\") to update term. Empirically it has been found that using small learning rates (such as `η < 0.1`) yields dramatic improvements in model's generalization ability over gradient boosting without shrinking (`η = 1`). However, it comes at the price of increasing computational time both during training and prediction: lower learning rate requires more iterations."

Friedman observed a substantial improvement in gradient boosting's accuracy with this modification.\n",

    "Subsample size is some constant fraction `f` of the size of the training set. When `f = 1`, the algorithm is deterministic and identical to the one described above. Smaller values of f introduce randomness into the algorithm and help prevent over-fitting, acting as a kind of regularization. The algorithm also becomes faster, because regression trees have to be fit to smaller datasets at each iteration. Typically, `f` is set to 0.5, meaning that one half of the training set is used to build each base learner.\n",

For example, the feature space corresponding Gaussian kernel is a Hilbert space of infinite dimension.
