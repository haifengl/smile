    "# Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters) so that observations in the same cluster are similar in some sense. Clustering is a method of unsupervised learning, and a common technique for statistical data analysis used in many fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical algorithms find successive clusters using previously established clusters. These algorithms usually are either agglomerative (\"bottom-up\") or divisive (\"top-down\"). Agglomerative algorithms begin with each element as a separate cluster and merge them into successively larger clusters. Divisive algorithms begin with the whole set and proceed to divide it into successively smaller clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Partitional algorithms typically determine all clusters at once, but can also be used as divisive algorithms in the hierarchical clustering. Many partitional clustering algorithms require the specification of the number of clusters to produce in the input data set, prior to execution of the algorithm. Barring knowledge of the proper value beforehand, the appropriate value must be determined, a problem on its own for which a number of techniques have been developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Density-based clustering algorithms are devised to discover arbitrary-shaped clusters. In this approach, a cluster is regarded as a region in which the density of data objects exceeds a threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subspace clustering methods look for clusters that can only be seen in a particular projection (subspace, manifold) of the data. These methods thus can ignore irrelevant attributes. The general problem is also known as Correlation clustering while the special case of axis-parallel subspaces is also known as two-way clustering, co-clustering or biclustering in bioinformatics: in these methods not only the objects are clustered but also the features of the objects, i.e., if the data is represented in a data matrix, the rows and columns are clustered simultaneously. They usually do not however work with arbitrary feature combinations as in general subspace methods."

    "## Deterministic Annealing Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "The observation of annealing processes in physical chemistry motivated the use of similar concepts to avoid local minima of the optimization cost. Certain chemical systems can be driven to their low-energy states by annealing, which is a gradual reduction of temperature, spending a long time at the vicinity of the phase transition points. In the corresponding probabilistic framework, a Gibbs distribution is defined over the set of all possible configurations which assigns higher probability to configurations of lower energy. This distribution is parameterized by the temperature, and as the temperature is lowered it becomes more discriminating (concentrating most of the probability in a smaller subset of low-energy configurations). At the limit of low temperature it assigns nonzero probability only to global minimum configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A known technique for nonconvex optimization that capitalizes on this physical analogy is simulated annealing based on the Metropolis algorithm. A sequence of random moves is generated and the random decision to accept a move depends on the cost of the resulting configuration relative to that of the current state. However, one must be very careful with the annealing schedule, i.e., the rate at which the temperature is lowered. In theory, the global minimum can be achieved if the schedule obeys `T ∝ 1 / log n`, where `n` is the number of the current iteration. Such schedules are not realistic in many applications. It was shown that perturbations of infinite variance (e.g., the Cauchy distribution) provide better ability to escape from minima and allow, in principle, the use of faster schedules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deterministic annealing tries to enjoy the best of both worlds. On the one hand it is deterministic, meaning that we do not want to be wandering randomly on the energy surface while making incremental progress on the average, as is the case for simulated annealing. On the other hand, it is still an annealing method and aims at the global minimum, instead of getting greedily attracted to a nearby local minimum. One can view deterministic annealing as replacing stochastic simulations by the use of expectation. An effective energy function, which is parameterized by a (pseudo) temperature, is derived through expectation and is deterministically optimized at successively reduced temperatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deterministic annealing clustering is based on principles of information theory and probability theory, and it consists of minimizing the clustering cost at prescribed levels of randomness. The method provides soft clustering solutions at different scales, where the scale is directly related to the temperature parameter. For each temperature value, the algorithm iterates between the calculation of all posteriori probabilities and the update of the centroids vectors, until convergence is reached. There are \"phase transitions\" in the design process, where phases correspond to the number of effective clusters in the solution, which grows via splits as the temperature is lowered. The annealing starts with a high temperature. Here, all centroids vectors converge to the center of the pattern distribution (independent of their initial positions). Below a critical temperature the vectors start to split. Further decreasing the temperature leads to more splittings until all centroids vectors are separate. The annealing can therefore avoid (if it is sufficiently slow) the convergence to local minima. If a limitation on the number of clusters is imposed, then at zero temperature a hard clustering solution is obtained."

However, the common batch updating rule (assigning all instances to nearest centroids and then updating centroids) of K-Means won't work in SIB, which has to work in a sequential way (reassigning (if better) each instance then immediately update related centroids). It might be because K-L divergence is very sensitive and the centroids may be significantly changed in each iteration in batch updating rule.\n",
