    "# Interpolation\n",
    "Interpolation is the process of constructing a function that takes on specified values at specified points. In engineering and science, one often has a number of data points, obtained by sampling or experimentation, which represent the values of a function for a limited number of values of the independent variable. It is often required to interpolate (i.e. estimate) the value of that function for an intermediate value of the independent variable.\n",

    "## RBF Interpolation\n",
    "Radial basis function interpolation is a popular method for the data points are irregularly distributed in space. In its basic form, radial basis function interpolation is in the form `y(x) = Σ wi φ(||x-ci||)`, where the approximating function `y(x)` is represented as a sum of N radial basis functions φ, each associated with a different center ci, and weighted by an appropriate coefficient wi. For distance, one usually chooses euclidean distance. The weights wi can be estimated using the matrix methods of linear least squares, because the approximating function is linear in the weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "The points ci often called the centers or collocation points of the RBF interpolant. Note also that the centers ci can be located at arbitrary points in the domain, and do not require a grid. For certain RBF exponential convergence has been shown. Radial basis functions were successfully applied to problems as diverse as computer graphics, neural networks, for the solution of differential equations via collocation methods and many other problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other popular choices for φ comprise the Gaussian function and the so called thin plate splines. Thin plate splines result from the solution of a variational problem. The advantage of the thin plate splines is that their conditioning is invariant under scalings. Gaussians, multi-quadrics and inverse multi-quadrics are infinitely smooth and and involve a scale or shape parameter, r0 > 0. Decreasing r0 tends to flatten the basis function. For a given function, the quality of approximation may strongly depend on this parameter. In particular, increasing r0 has the effect of better conditioning (the separation distance of the scaled points increases).\n",
    "\n",
    "A variant on RBF interpolation is normalized radial basis function (NRBF) interpolation, in which we require the sum of the basis functions to be unity. NRBF arises more naturally from a Bayesian statistical perspective. However, there is no evidence that either the NRBF method is consistently superior to the RBF method, or vice versa."

    "Shepard interpolation is a special case of normalized radial basis function interpolation if the function φ(r) goes to infinity as `r → 0`, and is finite for `r > 0`. In this case, the weights wi are just equal to the respective function values yi. So we need not solve linear equations and thus it works for very large N. An example of such φ is `φ(r) = r^-p` with (typically) `1 < p ≤ 3`."
