    "Smile implements `beta`, `erf`, `gamma` and their related functions. Special functions are particular mathematical functions which have more or less established names and notations due to their importance in mathematical analysis, functional analysis, physics, or other applications. Many special functions appear as solutions of differential equations or integrals of elementary functions. For example, the error function `erf` (also called the Gauss error function) is a special function of sigmoid shape which occurs in probability, statistics, materials science, and partial differential equations. The complementary error function, denoted `erfc`, is defined as `erfc(x) = 1 - erf(x)`. The error function and complementary error function are special cases of the incomplete `gamma` function."
