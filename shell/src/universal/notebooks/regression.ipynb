Different algorithms use different formulae for measuring \"best\". Used by the CART algorithm, Gini impurity is a measure of how often a randomly chosen element from the set would be incorrectly labeled if it were randomly labeled according to the distribution of labels in the subset. Gini impurity can be computed by summing the probability of each item being chosen times the probability of a mistake in categorizing that item. It reaches its minimum (zero) when all cases in the node fall into a single target category. Information gain is another popular measure, used by the ID3, C4.5 and C5.0 algorithms. Information gain is based on the concept of entropy used in information theory.

With `J = 3` the model may include effects of the interaction between up to two variables, and so on. Hastie et al. comment that typically `4 â¤ J â¤ 8` work well for boosting and results are fairly insensitive to the choice of in this range, `J = 2` is insufficient for many applications, and J > 10 is unlikely to be required.\n",

    "Fitting the training set too closely can lead to degradation of the model's generalization ability. Several so-called regularization techniques reduce this over-fitting effect by constraining the fitting procedure. One natural regularization parameter is the number of gradient boosting iterations T (i.e. the number of trees in the model when the base learner is a decision tree). Increasing T reduces the error on training set, but setting it too high may lead to over-fitting. An optimal value of T is often selected by monitoring prediction error on a separate validation data set.\n",

Empirically it has been found that using small learning rates (such as Î· < 0.1) yields dramatic improvements in model's generalization ability over gradient boosting without shrinking (`Î· = 1`).

The points in the active set could be selected randomly, but in general we might expect better performance if the points are selected greedily w.r.t. some criterion.
