### Setting -X directly (-J is stripped)

# Use up to 75% RAM for maximum size of heap
#-J-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75

# Or explicit heap size with Xms and Xmx Options
# The most important tuning option for ZGC is setting
# the maximum heap size with the -Xmx option.
-J-Xmx4G -J-Xms2G

### Performance optimization

# Reduce the size of object headers in the HotSpot JVM from between 96 and
# 128 bits down to 64 bits on 64-bit architectures. This will reduce heap
# size, improve deployment density, and increase data locality.
-J-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -J-XX:+UseCompactObjectHeaders

# ZGC for large heap size and low-latency requirements.
-J-XX:+UseZGC

# Enable the large page size to optimize processor TLB.
# Configuring ZGC to use large pages will generally yield better performance
# and comes with no real disadvantage. The setup process typically requires
# root privileges, which is why it's not enabled by default.
#-J-XX:+UseLargePages -J-XX:LargePageSizeInBytes=2M

# UseCompressedOop is on by default for up to 32GB heap.
# The below tuning enables it up to 64GB with object alignment at 16.
#-J-XX:+UseCompressedOops -J-XX:ObjectAlignmentInBytes=16

# Enable NUMA-aware allocators.
# JVM automatically turns off the flag when run on a single node
-J-XX:+UseNUMA

# Optimize string duplication, which happens a lot when parsing a data file.
-J-XX:+UseStringDeduplication

# Turn on JVM debugging, open at the given port
# -jvm-debug <port>
-J-XX:-PrintGCDetails

# enabling debug and sending -d as app argument
# the '--' prevents app-parameter swallowing when
# using a reserved parameter. See #184
# -d -- -d
